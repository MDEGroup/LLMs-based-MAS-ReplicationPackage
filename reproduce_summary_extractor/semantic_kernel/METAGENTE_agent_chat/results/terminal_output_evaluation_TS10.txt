Extracted text: Bolts is a collection of low-level libraries designed to make developing mobile apps easier. Bolts was designed by Parse and Facebook for our own internal use, and we have decided to open source these libraries to make them available to others. Using these libraries does not require using any Parse services, nor do they require having a Parse or Facebook developer account.

Bolts includes:
- "Tasks", which make organization of complex asynchronous code more manageable. A task is kind of like a JavaScript Promise, but available for iOS and Android.
- An implementation of App Links, helping you link to content in other apps and handle incoming deep-links.

Extracted text: # SpecuCheck

SpecuCheck is a Windows utility for checking the state of the software and hardware mitigations against CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown), CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre v2), CVE-2018-3260 (Foreshadow), and CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre v4). It uses two new information classes that were added to the NtQuerySystemInformation API call as part of the recent patches introduced in January 2018 and reports the data as seen by the Windows Kernel.

On January 3rd 2018, Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings, as well as a number of OS Vendors reported a series of vulnerabilities that were discovered by Google Project Zero:

* Variant 1: bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753)
* Variant 2: branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715)
* Variant 3: rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754)

Microsoft released patches for Windows 7 SP1 and higher later that same day. These patches, depending on architecture, OS version, boot settings and a number of hardware-related properties, apply a number of software and hardware mitigations against these issues. The enablement state of these mitigations, their availability, and configuration is stored by the Windows kernel in a number of global variables, and exposed to user-mode callers through an undocumented system call.

Additionally, new side channel attacks were reported, such as Spectre Variant 4: speculative store bypass (CVE-2018-3639) and Foreshadow: L1 terminal fault (CVE-2018-3620) which were fixed in Windows 7 SP1 and higher with patches in August's Patch Tuesday.

SpecuCheck takes advantage of this system call in order to confirm if a system has indeed been patched (non-patched systems will fail the call) and what the status of the mitigations are, which can be used to determine potential performance pitfalls.

Bender is an abstraction layer over MetalPerformanceShaders useful for working with neural networks. It is of growing interest in the AI environment to execute neural networks on mobile devices even if the training process has been done previously. We want to make it easier for everyone to execute pretrained networks on iOS.

Bender allows you to easily define and run neural networks using the most common layers like Convolution, Pooling, FullyConnected and some normalizations among others. It is also flexible in the way it receives the parameters for these layers.

We also want to support loading models trained on other frameworks such as TensorFlow or Caffe2. Currently, Bender includes an adapter for TensorFlow that loads a graph with variables and "translates" it to Bender layers. This feature supports a subset of TensorFlow's operations but we plan to enhance it to cover more cases.

### A Very High Performance Objective-C JSON Library

JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, is a lightweight, text-based, serialization format for structured data that is used by many web-based services and APIs. JSON provides the following primitive types: Null, Boolean, Number, String, Array, and Object (a.k.a. Associative Arrays, Key / Value Hash Tables, Maps, Dictionaries, etc.). 

JSONKit uses Core Foundation internally, and it is assumed that Core Foundation is equivalent to Foundation for every equivalent base type. JSONKit aims for strict conformance to the JSON specification and handles Unicode in accordance with the Unicode Standard.

### Introduction
At Agoda, we have more than 1000 automated tests to ensure our applications quality and give our best experience to the user. All of them are written with Espresso from Google. Even though Espresso is working really well with our test, the code readability is quite low. As Agoda developers, we want to improve not just our codebase quality, but also our implementation of tests as well. This is why we are introducing Kakao. The library that will make you enjoy writing automated tests like you are drinking a hot chocolate.

- Description: Kubernetes-native system managing the full lifecycle of conformant Kubernetes clusters as a service on Alicloud, AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack, vSphere, KubeVirt, Hetzner, EquinixMetal, MetalStack, and OnMetal with minimal TCO.

Extracted text: # Gardener

Gardener implements the automated management and operation of clusters as a service and provides a fully validated extensibility framework that can be adjusted to any programmatic cloud or infrastructure provider.

Gardener is 100% Kubernetes-native and exposes its own Cluster API to create homogeneous clusters on all supported infrastructures. This API harmonizes not only how to get to clusters but also the make-up of the clusters themselves, ensuring homogeneous clusters with the same bill of material, configuration, and behavior across all supported infrastructures.

Gardener's main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks. It introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (garden cluster) for managing end-user Kubernetes clusters (shoot clusters). These shoot clusters are described via specifications observed by controllers that manage their lifecycle, including bringing up the clusters, reconciling their state, and performing automated updates.

To ensure reliability and high quality of service, Gardener controls the main components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, API server, controller manager, scheduler) hosted in seed clusters. This architecture, referred to as kubeception or inception design, reduces total cost of ownership and simplifies "day-2 operations" by utilizing mature Kubernetes features.

Gardener reuses the identical Kubernetes design to span a scalable multi-cloud and multi-cluster landscape, easing the initial learning curve and accelerating developer productivity.

This library adds Presenters to Activities and Fragments. It favors the stateful Presenter pattern, where the Presenter survives configuration changes and the dumb View pattern, where the View only sends user events and receives information from the Presenter but never actively asks for data. This makes testing very easy because no logic lives in the View (Activity, Fragment) except for fancy animations which anyways aren't testable.

Extracted text: # orjson

orjson is a fast, correct JSON library for Python. It is the fastest Python library for JSON and is more correct than the standard json library or other third-party libraries. It serializes datetime, numpy, dataclass, and UUID instances natively.

Its features and drawbacks compared to other Python JSON libraries include:

* Serializes datetime instances 40-50x as fast as other libraries.
* Serializes datetime instances to RFC 3339 format, e.g., "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00".
* Serializes numpy instances 4-12x as fast with 0.3x the memory usage of other libraries.
* Pretty prints 10x to 20x as fast as the standard library.
* Serializes to bytes rather than str, i.e., is not a drop-in replacement.
* Serializes unicode without escaping to ASCII, e.g., "你好" rather than "u597d".
* Serializes dataclass instances 10x as fast and deserializes twice as fast as other libraries.
* Serializes subclasses of datetime, numpy, dataclass, and UUID natively, requiring an opt-in to specify how to serialize others.
* Serializes arbitrary types using a default hook.
* Has strict UTF-8 conformance, more correct than the standard library.
* Has strict JSON conformance in not supporting NaN/Infinity/-Infinity.
* Has an option for strict JSON conformance on 53-bit integers with default support for 64-bit.
* Does not provide read or write functions for file-like objects.

orjson supports CPython 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. It distributes wheels for various architectures and operating systems. orjson does not and will not support PyPy or PEP 554 subinterpreters. Releases follow semantic versioning, and serializing a new object type without an opt-in flag is considered a breaking change.

orjson is licensed under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses.

Extracted text: # Carbon Language: An experimental successor to C++

C++ remains the dominant programming language for performance-critical software, with massive and growing codebases and investments. However, it is struggling to improve and meet developers' needs, largely due to accumulating decades of technical debt. Incrementally improving C++ is challenging, both due to the technical debt itself and challenges with its evolution process. The best way to address these problems is to avoid inheriting the legacy of C or C++ directly and instead start with solid language foundations like modular code organization and consistent, simple syntax.

Carbon is fundamentally a successor language approach, designed around interoperability with C++ as well as large-scale adoption and migration for existing C++ codebases and developers. It aims to match C++ performance, provide seamless interoperability, and offer a gentle learning curve for C++ developers. Carbon is designed to support performance-critical software, software and language evolution, and practical safety and testing mechanisms, while also ensuring fast and scalable development.

Password Safe is a password database utility. Like many other such products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "safe combination"), instead of all the username/password combinations that you use.

What makes Password Safe different? Three things:  
1. Simplicity: Password Safe is designed to do one thing, and to do it well. Start the application, enter your "combination", double-click on the right entry - presto - the password is now on your clipboard, ready for pasting.  
2. Security: The original version was designed by Bruce Schneier - nuff said.  
3. Open Source: The source code for the project is available for inspection.  

The current version of Password Safe currently runs on Windows 7 and later. Older versions are still available supporting Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista as well as PocketPC. Support for additional platforms is planned for future releases.  

Linux packages are also available for popular distributions. FreeBSD is also supported.

Extracted text: # Introduction

The facets project contains two visualizations for understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets: Facets Overview and Facets Dive. The visualizations are implemented as web components and can be easily embedded into Jupyter notebooks or webpages.

## Facets Overview

Overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. It produces a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis and can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets. The tool can process both numeric and string features, including multiple instances of a number or string per feature. Overview can help uncover issues with datasets, including unexpected feature values, missing feature values for a large number of examples, and training/test/validation set skew. Key aspects of the visualization are outlier detection and distribution comparison across multiple datasets.

## Facets Dive

Dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details. Each example is represented as a single item in the visualization, and the points can be positioned by faceting/bucketing in multiple dimensions by their feature values.

Many services exist that can provide holiday information, however are either not entirely free or only offer limited information. In addition, no exhaustive PHP library exists today covering a wide range of holidays and countries. 

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible. Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state), making it easy to add new holiday providers that calculate holidays.

Extracted text: # SeaweedFS

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file's metadata. It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

SeaweedFS started by implementing erasure coding with ideas from other systems and has a lot of similarities with them.

On top of the object store, an optional Filer can support directories and POSIX attributes. Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

For any distributed key-value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, SeaweedFS can work as a distributed Key-Large-Value store.

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. With hot data on the local cluster and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity. What's more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized, making it faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage!

The drawer is opened by a bezel swipe from the right of the screen. From here you can change and view all of the developer options of the application.\n\nThe most notable feature the debug version exposes is the concept of endpoints. Using the spinner at the top of the drawer, you can change the endpoint to which the app communicates. We also expose a false endpoint named "Mock Mode" which simulates an in-memory server inside the app. This "Mock Mode" eases manual testing and also provides a static set of data to write instrumentation tests against.\n\nIn order to keep the shared state which represents the server-side data we use a singleton. At present this is only done with a combination of in-memory collections and images. In a more complex app you could even use a full database. This class is injected into each mock service which uses its methods to query and mutate state.

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful version control system for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use. It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user interface and version control algorithms from the storage systems used to serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical backends, that may have their own data or networking models. Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content, making it compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools. 

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include Git, Mercurial, and Pijul. Jujutsu also adds several innovative features of its own, such as automatic commits for the working copy, an operation log for undoing actions, and safe concurrent replication.

Gremlins.js simulates random user actions: gremlins click anywhere in the window, enter random data in forms, or move the mouse over elements that don't expect it.

Code 10 indicates structural absence of the tie, i.e., at least one of the involved students was not yet part of the school cohort, or had already left the school cohort at the given time point.

Tobacco use has the scores 1 (non), 2 (occasional) and 3 (regular, i.e. more than once per week). The idea of this code is to simulate the opinion change over time according to the initial values and the network provided by the data set.

Extracted text: # Python-mode, a Python IDE for Vim

Python-mode is a Vim plugin that magically converts Vim into a Python IDE.

Why Python-mode?

1. Be more productive: Pymode saves time by bringing all the tools necessary for professional developers so that you can focus on bigger things. It has been finely tuned based on decades of experience working with Vim and is constantly kept up to date.
2. Get smart assistance: Pymode knows all about your code. We use the best-in-class intellisense code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes; easy project navigation and much more.
3. Use the full power and capabilities of Vim: Unlike traditional IDEs which can only provide a small subset of Vim functionalities, you can do everything and anything that you can in Vim.
4. Modular structure: We attempt to create Python-mode with the same principles of python: i.e. have a modular structure, so that as and when better libraries evolve, we can provide you the best experience, while abstracting the details so that you can get back to what you do best.
5. Written mostly in Python: 96.1% written in Python. Well, we love Python :)

The plugin contains all you need to develop python applications in Vim.

* Support Python and 3.6+
* Syntax highlighting
* Virtualenv support
* Run python code
* Add/remove breakpoints
* Improved Python indentation
* Python motions and operators

## Introduction

This guide will take you through the steps necessary to continuously deliver your software to end users by leveraging Jenkins and Kubernetes to orchestrate the software delivery pipeline. If you are not familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts, have a look at the documentation.

In order to accomplish this goal you will use the following Jenkins plugins:
- Start Jenkins build executor containers in the Kubernetes cluster when builds are requested, terminate those containers when builds complete, freeing resources up for the rest of the cluster.
- Define our build pipeline declaratively and keep it checked into source code management alongside our application code.
- Allows you to add your Google OAuth credentials to Jenkins.

In order to deploy the application with Kubernetes, you will use the following resources:
- Replicates our application across our Kubernetes nodes and allows us to do a controlled rolling update of our software across the fleet of application instances.
- Load balancing and service discovery for our internal services.
- External load balancing and SSL termination for our external service.
- Secure storage of non-public configuration information, specifically SSL certs in our case.

Boot is a Clojure build framework and ad-hoc Clojure script evaluator. Boot provides a runtime environment that includes all of the tools needed to build Clojure projects from scripts written in Clojure that run in the context of the project.

Build processes for applications always end up being complex things. A simple web application, for instance, may require many integrations–asset pipelines, deployment to different environments, the compilation of multiple artifacts with different compilers, packaging, etc.

The more complex the build process becomes, the more flexible the build tool needs to be. Static build specifications become less and less useful as the project moves toward completion. Being Lispers we know what to do: Lambda is the ultimate declarative.

Instead of building the project based on a global configuration map, Boot provides a runtime environment in which a build script written in Clojure can be evaluated. It is this script—a Turing-complete build specification—which builds the project.

Extracted text: # almond

A replacement loader for AMD modules. It provides a minimal AMD API footprint that includes support. Only useful for built/bundled AMD modules, does not do dynamic loading.

Some developers prefer to use the AMD API for modular JavaScript but do not want to include a full AMD loader like RequireJS after an optimized build, as they may not need all that functionality. This is particularly important for use cases sensitive to file sizes, such as mobile applications.

By including almond in the built file, there is no need for RequireJS. Almond is around 1 kilobyte when minified with Closure Compiler and gzipped. It supports certain types of loader plugin-optimized resources, making it a great fit for libraries that want to use AMD as part of their project while achieving a tiny download in one file after optimization.

If you are building a library, the wrap=true support in the RequireJS optimizer will wrap the optimized file in a closure, so the define/require AMD API does not escape the file. Users of your optimized file will only see the global API you decide to export, not the AMD API. This results in great code cleanliness with AMD and the use of powerful loader plugins in a tiny wrapper, making it easy for others to use your code even if they do not use AMD.

### Introduction ###

The purpose of Projeny is to allow your Unity3D project to easily scale in size without heavily impacting development time.

Projeny allows you to:

* Share any Unity assets (code, scenes, prefabs, etc.) across multiple different Unity projects without copy and pasting
* Instantly switch between platforms
* Easily upgrade or downgrade installed asset store packages
* Optimize compile time of your project by getting Unity to only recompile the code that changes most often
* Split up your project into discrete packages, so that you can manage the dependencies between each, instead of having one giant Unity project of inter-related files
* Declare dependencies between packages, so that you always get the packages that you need without needing to hunt down missing libraries or broken links
* Generate a more intelligent Visual Studio solution than the Unity default, using package dependencies to create csproj dependencies

This project is open source. If you're interested in helping, great! There's still a number of features we'd like to support eventually (in particular we need help with supporting OSX).

NOTE: Projeny requires Unity3D 5.3.1 or higher, since it makes use of the command line switch that is only fixed in 5.3.1.

OpenLoco is an open-source re-implementation of Chris Sawyer's Locomotion, a construction and management simulation video game that simulates running a transport company. OpenLoco aims to improve the game similar to how other projects have enhanced Transport Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon. The reimplementation efforts are gradual, with the goal of rewriting the entire game in C++. The project has already reimplemented the in-game UI and uncovered most underlying data and object structures, with recent efforts focused on reimplementing the game logic. Future goals include enhancing multiplayer experience and increasing map and vehicle limits, while currently being bound by the limits of the original game's save format.

Extracted text: Certbot is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.

Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free.

Certbot is meant to be run directly on your web server on the command line, not on your personal computer. If you’re using a hosted service and don’t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.

QuickCheck for Swift.

Introduction
============

SwiftCheck is a testing library that automatically generates random data for testing of program properties. A property is a particular facet of an algorithm or data structure that must be invariant under a given set of input data, basically an assertion on steroids. Where before all we could do was define methods prefixed by assert, SwiftCheck allows program properties and tests to be treated like data.

To define a program property, the quantifier is used with a type signature. SwiftCheck implements the protocol for most Swift Standard Library types and implements the protocol for several other related types. For example, if we wanted to test the property that every Integer is equal to itself, we would express it as such.

All you have to figure out is what to test. SwiftCheck will handle the rest.

Expecto tests are parallel and async by default, so that you can use all your cores for testing your software. This also opens up a new way of catching threading and memory issues for free using stress testing.

With Expecto you write tests as values. Tests can be composed, reduced, filtered, repeated and passed as values, because they are values. This gives the programmer a lot of leverage when writing tests. Setup and teardown are just simple functions, no need for attributes.

Expecto comes with batteries included with an integrated test runner, but its still open for extension due to its compositional model.

Expecto comes with performance testing, making statistically sound performance comparison simple.

My source code is irrelevant. Read the wiki and implement your own renderer. Only when you suffer through all the tiny details you will learn what is going on.

In this project, I want to show the way OpenGL works by writing its clone (a much simplified one). Surprisingly enough, I often meet people who cannot overcome the initial hurdle of learning OpenGL / DirectX. Thus, I have prepared a short series of lectures, after which my students show quite good renderers.

The task is formulated as follows: using no third-party libraries (especially graphic ones), get something like a rendered model from a test file with a polygonal wire and pictures with textures. The program simply generates an image without a graphical interface.

Since the goal is to minimize external dependencies, I provide my students just one class that allows working with image files in RGB/RGBA/black and white formats. The only functionality available at the very beginning is the capability to set the color of one pixel. There are no functions for drawing line segments and triangles; we’ll have to do all of this by hand.

Extracted text: # neural-storyteller

neural-storyteller is a recurrent neural network that generates little stories about images. This repository contains code for generating stories with your own images, as well as instructions for training new models. 

The style-shifting operation allows our model to transfer standard image captions to the style of stories from novels. The only source of supervision in our models is from captions, meaning we did not collect any new training data to directly predict stories given images. 

We first train a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder on romance novels, mapping each passage from a novel to a skip-thought vector. The RNN conditions on the skip-thought vector to generate the encoded passage. Parallelly, we train a visual-semantic embedding between COCO images and captions, mapping captions and images into a common vector space. 

Given these models, we construct a function to bridge the gap between retrieved image captions and passages in novels, allowing us to generate stories based on images.

* Drawing API - to create basic shapes and advanced charts, write text on the image
* Masking functionality - ability to apply black & white or grayscale images as masks, leading to semi-transparency or absolute transparency of the image the mask is being applied to.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps.

Tools and standards abound for creating and enriching metadata, but measuring, monitoring, and managing metadata for the long haul can be a daunting task. What tools are out there to assess the shape of our metadata? How can visualizations show us the gaps or flaws in our description? What can web traffic analytics tell us about the value of our metadata? What is quality, really? We certainly don’t have all the answers, but together we can workshop the questions. Specific topics will be driven by the interest of attendees. The organizers will bring examples of their own work at NYPL in visualization, data analysis with Python, and Google analytics assessment and invite participants to bring their own tools and strategies to share in group discussion, short demos, and hands-on breakout sessions. Takeaways will include: exposure to approaches and tools in use in the field and an expanded network of commiserators to help you through your next metadata audit.

Extracted text: # How To Train an Object Detection Classifier for Multiple Objects Using TensorFlow (GPU) on Windows 10

## Brief Summary
This repository is a tutorial for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Windows 10, 8, or 7. It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.5, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow. The repository provides all the files needed to train a "Pinochle Deck" playing card detector that can accurately detect nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings, and aces. The tutorial describes how to replace these files with your own files to train a detection classifier for whatever your heart desires. It also has Python scripts to test your classifier out on an image, video, or webcam feed.

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to train your own convolutional neural network object detection classifier for multiple objects, starting from scratch. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a program that can identify and draw boxes around specific objects in pictures, videos, or in a webcam feed. This tutorial is written for Windows 10, and it will also work for Windows 7 and 8. The general procedure can also be used for Linux operating systems, but file paths and package installation commands will need to change accordingly. TensorFlow-GPU allows your PC to use the video card to provide extra processing power while training, significantly reducing training time compared to the CPU-only version.

- Description: List of Elixir books

Extracted text: # Awesome Elixir Books

Adoption is more than programming. Elixir is an exciting new language, but to successfully get your application from start to finish, you’re going to need to know more than just the language. You need the case studies and strategies in this book. Learn the best practices for the whole life of your application, from design and team-building, to managing stakeholders, to deployment and monitoring. Go beyond the syntax and the tools to learn the techniques you need to develop your Elixir application from concept to production.

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

Elixir in Action teaches you how to solve practical problems of scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability using Elixir. You'll start with the language, learning basic constructs and building blocks. Then, you'll learn to think about problems using Elixir's functional programming mindset. With that solid foundation, you'll confidently explore Elixir's seamless integration with BEAM and Erlang's powerful OTP framework of battle-tested abstractions you can use immediately. Finally, the book provides guidance on how to distribute a system over multiple machines and control it in production.

This is an introductory book about Elixir and OTP, written to go straight to the point. Almost 100 pages to learn the language and the platform.

In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can write in Elixir. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular Elixir programming concept. These programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in the book Introducing Elixir.

Official Elixir starting guide that will take you through the language foundations. You will also explore how to build projects with Mix and OTP, and it will introduce you to more advanced techniques such as meta-programming.

Elixir is an excellent language if you want to learn about functional programming, and with this hands-on introduction, you’ll discover just how powerful and fun Elixir can be. This language combines the robust functional programming of Erlang with a syntax similar to Ruby, and includes powerful features for metaprogramming.

Elixir’s straightforward syntax and this guided tour give you a clean, simple path to learn modern functional programming techniques. No previous functional programming experience required! This book walks you through the right concepts at the right pace, as you explore immutable values and explicit data transformation, functions, modules, recursive functions, pattern matching, high-order functions, polymorphism, and failure handling, all while avoiding side effects.

Hey there! This is Learn You Some Erlang for great good! This book is for you if you’ve got some programming experience and if you’re not too familiar with functional programming. It can still be useful if you’re too good for that, as we progressively go into more and more advanced topics.

Elixir, based on Erlang’s virtual machine and ecosystem, makes it easier to achieve scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability goals that are pursued by developers using any programming language or programming paradigm. Elixir is a modern programming language that utilizes the benefits offered by Erlang VM without really incorporating the complex syntaxes of Erlang.

This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, completely updated for Elixir 1.6 and beyond. Explore functional programming without the academic overtones. Create concurrent applications, but get them right without all the locking and consistency headaches. Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir’s pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it’s Elixir.

The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook gets you started programming applications with Elixir and OTP. You begin with a quick overview of the Elixir language syntax, along with just enough functional programming to use it effectively. Then, you'll dive straight into OTP and learn how it helps you build scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed applications through several fun examples. Come rediscover the joy of programming with Elixir and remember how it feels like to be a beginner again.

Want to learn an up and coming functional programming language? Check out Elixir, designed by Ruby on Rails core team member Jose Valim. If you have a full-time day job, a family, or other pressing commitments, taking hours out of your week to read blog posts or spending the time to contribute to open source could be a deal breaker for you. This book helps to get you up to speed with what you need to know.

Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your own server. You always know who has your data. You do.

Here are some of the things that you can do with Huginn:

* Track the weather and get an email when it's going to rain (or snow) tomorrow.
* List terms that you care about and receive email when their occurrence on Twitter changes.
* Watch for air travel or shopping deals.
* Follow your project names on Twitter and get updates when people mention them.
* Scrape websites and receive email when they change.
* Connect to various services like Adioso, HipChat, FTP, IMAP, Jabber, JIRA, MQTT, nextbus, Pushbullet, Pushover, RSS, Bash, Slack, StubHub, translation APIs, Twilio, Twitter, and Weibo.
* Send digest email with things that you care about at specific times during the day.
* Track counts of high frequency events and send an SMS within moments when they spike.
* Send and receive WebHooks.
* Run custom JavaScript or CoffeeScript functions.
* Track your location over time.
* Create Amazon Mechanical Turk workflows as the inputs, or outputs, of agents.

Active Merchant is an extraction from the ecommerce system. Shopify's requirements for a simple and unified API to access dozens of different payment gateways with very different internal APIs was the chief principle in designing the library.

It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly as a Rails plugin, but it also works excellently as a stand-alone Ruby library.

Active Merchant has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used in most modern Ruby applications which deal with financial transactions. It is maintained by the teams, with much help from an ever-growing set of contributors.

Feature.js automatically initializes itself on page load, so you don’t have to. It doesn’t, however, run any tests while initializing, so it will only ever run them when you ask it to. This makes it perform very fast.

With Feature.js, it’s simple to build progressively enhanced experiences that use feature detection to determine if a code can be executed in the user’s browser.

Yet another Markdown parser, this time for JavaScript. There are a few options that precede this project but they all treat Markdown to HTML conversion as a single step process. You pass Markdown in and get HTML out, end of story. We had some pretty particular views on how the process should actually look, which include:

  * Producing well-formed HTML. This means that <div> and <span> nesting is important, as is the ability to output as both HTML and XHTML
  * Having an intermediate representation to allow processing of parsed data (we in fact have two, both a markdown tree and an HTML tree)
  * Being easily extensible to add new dialects without having to rewrite the entire parsing mechanics
  * Having a good test suite. The only test suites we could find tested massive blocks of input, and passing depended on outputting the HTML with exactly the same whitespace as the original implementation.

_CSS the way it was imagined._

Myth is a preprocessor that lets you write pure CSS without having to worry about slow browser support, or even slow spec approval. It's like a CSS polyfill.

Myth lets you write pure CSS while still giving you the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass. You can still use variables and math functions, just like you do in preprocessors. It's like a polyfill for future versions of the spec.

Some features in CSS require runtime calculations, which neither Myth nor preprocessors handle, but Myth allows you to write your code today in future syntax, making it future-proof. When browsers finally support these features, you won't need to rewrite anything; just start using the cascade!

Taking plain CSS as input means you can use Myth to re-process anyone else's CSS (or another preprocessor's output), adding the browser support you need without having to rewrite the code in a completely different syntax.

Myth is built with Rework, making it incredibly fast, and has a nice JavaScript API in addition to the CLI.

GCToolkit is a set of libraries for analyzing HotSpot Java garbage collection (GC) log files. The toolkit parses GC log files into discrete events and provides an API for aggregating data from those events. This allows the user to create arbitrary and complex analyses of the state of managed memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) represented by the garbage collection log.

Managed memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is composed of 3 main pieces:

1. Memory buffers known as Java heap

3. Garbage Collection (GC)

While GC is responsible for recovering memory in Java heap that is no longer in use, the term is often used as a euphemism for memory management. The best source of telemetry data for tuning GC comes from GC Logs, and GCToolKit has been helpful in making this task easier by providing parsers, models, and an API to build analytics with.

A layout engine for Android that decouples layouts from the View containers that manage scrolling and view recycling. FreeFlow makes it really easy to create custom layouts and beautiful transition animations as layouts are changed.

FreeFlow is a composition based approach to Android Layouts. As opposed to default Android Layouts, FreeFlow Layouts are swappable at runtime which allows views to their new states smoothly. The fundamental difference here is that FreeFlow prefers which makes the system a lot more adaptable.

Freeflow may be considered in "alpha". You can help in many ways, by reviewing and making suggestions on APIs to actually finding bugs and submitting patches via pull requests.

FreeFlow is inspired by UI frameworks like UICollectionViews on iOS and the Spark Architecture in Flex.

- Description: Application Kernel for Containers

Extracted text: ## What is gVisor?

gVisor is an application kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system surface. It includes a runtime that provides an isolation boundary between the application and the host kernel. The runtime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed containers.

## Why does gVisor exist?

Containers are not a sandbox. While containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, using them to run untrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not a good idea. gVisor is an application kernel for containers that limits the host kernel surface accessible to the application while still giving the application access to all the features it expects. Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or require a fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host kernel functionality and runs as a normal process.

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation. It is a pure Java solution, fully based on OSGi.

It is designed to be vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices, and interface protocols by dedicated bindings. These bindings send and receive commands and status updates on the openHAB event bus. This concept allows designing user interfaces with a unique look and feel, but with the possibility to operate devices based on a big number of different technologies. Besides the user interfaces, it also brings the power of automation logic across different system boundaries.

## Introduction
This project is a Rust implementation of {t,n}-threshold ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm).

Threshold ECDSA includes two protocols:

- Key Generation for creating secret shares.
- Signing for using the secret shares to generate a signature.

ECDSA is used extensively for crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (secp256k1 curve), NEO (NIST P-256 curve) and much more. This library can be used to create MultiSig and ThresholdSig crypto wallet. 

The library was built with four core design principles in mind:
1. Multi-protocol support
2. Built for cryptography engineers
3. Foolproof
4. Black box use of cryptographic primitives

## Introduction

BuildXL (Microsoft Build Accelerator) is a build engine originally developed for large internal teams at Microsoft. Internally at Microsoft, BuildXL runs 150,000+ builds per day on codebases up to a half-terabyte in size with a half-million process executions per build. It leverages distribution to thousands of data center machines and petabytes of source code, package, and build output caching. Thousands of developers use BuildXL on their desktops for faster builds.

BuildXL accelerates multiple build languages, including:
- MSBuild (experimental: using new features under development in MSBuild 16 which will ship in future versions of Visual Studio 2019 and the .NET Core SDK)
- CMake / Ninja (beta)
- Its own internal scripting language, DScript, an experimental TypeScript based format used as an intermediate language by a small number of teams inside Microsoft

BuildXL has a command-line interface. There are currently no plans to integrate it into Visual Studio. The project is open source in the spirit of transparency of our engineering system. You may find our technology useful if you face similar issues of scale. Note that BuildXL is not intended as a replacement for MSBuild or to indicate any future direction of build languages from Microsoft.

- Windows 10+
- Linux

- Modular component-based design: Feature implementations, above all, strive to be as generally applicable and configurable as possible, potentially at some cost of faithfully resembling details of the introducing paper.
- Separation of RL algorithm and application: Algorithms are agnostic to the type and structure of inputs (states/observations) and outputs (actions/decisions), as well as the interaction with the application environment.

### Abstract

The purpose of our research is to study reinforcement learning approaches to building a movie recommender system. We formulate the problem of interactive recommendation as a contextual multi-armed bandit, learning user preferences, recommending new movies, and receiving their ratings. We show that using reinforcement learning solves the problem of exploitation-exploration trade-off and the cold-start problem. We integrate the novelty of movies into the model. We explore a content-based approach as well as a collaborative filtering approach, and both yield viable recommendation results.

- Description: The HTML5 Creation Engine: Create beautiful digital content with the fastest, most flexible 2D WebGL renderer.

Extracted text: PixiJS — The HTML5 Creation Engine

This project aims to provide a fast, lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. The PixiJS renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. Also, it's fast. Really fast.

PixiJS is a rendering library that will allow you to create rich, interactive graphics and cross-platform applications and games without having to dive into the WebGL API or deal with browser and device compatibility. PixiJS has full support and seamlessly falls back to HTML5 if needed. As a framework, PixiJS is a fantastic tool for authoring interactive content, especially with the move away from Adobe Flash in recent years. Use it for your graphics-rich, interactive websites, applications, and HTML5 games. Out-of-the-box, cross-platform compatibility and graceful degradation mean you have less work to do and more fun doing it! If you want to create polished and refined experiences relatively quickly without delving into dense, low-level code, all while avoiding the headaches of browser inconsistencies, then sprinkle your next project with some PixiJS magic!

Extracted text: Cabot is a free, open-source, self-hosted infrastructure monitoring platform that provides some of the best features of Nagios and others without their cost and complexity. It offers a web interface to monitor services (e.g., "Stage Redis server", "Production ElasticSearch cluster") and send alerts via telephone, SMS, or email to your on-duty team if those services start misbehaving or go down, all without writing a line of code. You can alert based on metrics, status codes, response content of web endpoints, and build statuses. Cabot was created as a Christmas project because the developers found existing solutions inadequate for their use case. It is written in Python and utilizes various technologies under the hood.

Kubernetes-native security toolkit.

There are lots of security tools in the cloud native world, created by Aqua and by others, for identifying and informing users about security issues in Kubernetes workloads and infrastructure components. However powerful and useful they might be, they tend to sit alongside Kubernetes, with each new product requiring users to learn a separate set of commands and installation steps in order to operate them and find critical security information.

Starboard attempts to integrate heterogeneous security tools by incorporating their outputs into Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and from there, making security reports accessible through the Kubernetes API. This way users can find and view the risks that relate to different resources in what we call a Kubernetes-native way.

Starboard provides:

- Automated vulnerability scanning for Kubernetes workloads.
- Automated configuration audits for Kubernetes resources with predefined rules or custom Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies.
- Automated infrastructures scanning and compliance checks with CIS Benchmarks published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
- Automated compliance report - NSA, CISA Kubernetes Hardening Kubernetes Guidance v1.0 
- Penetration test results for a Kubernetes cluster.
- Custom Resource Definitions and a Go module to work with and integrate a range of security scanners.
- The Octant Plugin and the Lens Extension that make security reports available through familiar Kubernetes interfaces.

- Description: Dates and times made easy in iOS

Extracted text: ## DateTools

DateTools was written to streamline date and time handling in iOS. Classes and concepts from other languages served as an inspiration for DateTools, especially the structure and for .NET. Through these classes and others, DateTools removes the boilerplate required to access date components, handles more nuanced date comparisons, and serves as the foundation for entirely new concepts like Time Periods and their collections.

One of the missions of DateTools was to make Date feel more complete. There are many other languages that allow direct access to information about dates from their date classes, but Date (sadly) does not. It safely works only in the Unix time offsets through the timeIntervalSince... methods for building dates and remains calendar agnostic. But that's not always what we want to do. Sometimes, we want to work with dates based on their date components (like year, month, day, etc) at a more abstract level. This is where DateTools comes in.

Extracted text: tqdm
====

derives from the Arabic word taqaddum (تقدّم) which can mean "progress," and is an abbreviation for "I love you so much" in Spanish (te quiero demasiado).

Instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter - just wrap any iterable with tqdm, and you're done! 

It can also be executed as a module with pipes. Overhead is low -- about 60ns per iteration (80ns with tqdm), and is unit tested against performance regression. In addition to its low overhead, tqdm uses smart algorithms to predict the remaining time and to skip unnecessary iteration displays, which allows for a negligible overhead in most cases.

tqdm works on any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris/SunOS), in any console or in a GUI, and is also friendly with IPython/Jupyter notebooks. It does not require any dependencies (not even a terminal), just Python and an environment supporting ANSI control characters.

- Description: A Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm

Extracted text: # virtual-dom

A JavaScript library designed for efficient re-rendering of the DOM. 

Manual DOM manipulation is messy and keeping track of the previous DOM state is hard. A solution to this problem is to write your code as if you were recreating the entire DOM whenever state changes. However, recreating the entire DOM every time your application state changes would be slow and could cause input fields to lose focus.

This library is a collection of modules that provide a declarative way of representing the DOM for your app. Instead of updating the DOM when your application state changes, you create a virtual tree that resembles the desired DOM state. The library then efficiently updates the DOM to match this state without recreating all of the DOM nodes.

It allows you to update a view whenever state changes by creating a full representation of the view and then patching the DOM efficiently to match your description, promoting clean and maintainable rendering logic for web applications.

After the gems have been installed, Bundler can help you update some or all of them when new versions become available. Finally, it records the exact versions that have been installed, so that others can install the exact same gems.

Extracted text: # Dopamine

Dopamine is a research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms. It aims to fill the need for a small, easily grokked codebase in which users can freely experiment with wild ideas (speculative research).

Our design principles are:

* Easy experimentation: Make it easy for new users to run benchmark experiments.
* Flexible development: Make it easy for new users to try out research ideas.
* Compact and reliable: Provide implementations for a few, battle-tested algorithms.
* Reproducible: Facilitate reproducibility in results.

Dopamine supports various agents implemented with jax, including DQN, C51, Rainbow, IQN, and SAC. Many of these agents also have a tensorflow (legacy) implementation, though newly added agents are likely to be jax-only.

Extracted text: # zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.

If you have a trace ID in a log file, you can jump directly to it. Otherwise, you can query based on attributes such as service, operation name, tags, and duration. Some interesting data will be summarized for you, such as the percentage of time spent in a service and whether or not operations failed.

The Zipkin UI also presents a dependency diagram showing how many traced requests went through each application, which can be helpful for identifying aggregate behavior including error paths or calls to deprecated services.

Applications need to be instrumented to report trace data to Zipkin, usually via HTTP or Kafka, though many other options exist. The data served to the UI is stored in-memory or persistently with a supported backend such as Apache Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

Extracted text: # Selfie

Selfie is a project at the Department of Computer Sciences of the University of Salzburg in Austria.

The Selfie Project provides an educational platform for teaching undergraduate and graduate students the design and implementation of programming languages and runtime systems. The focus is on the construction of compilers, libraries, operating systems, and virtual machine monitors. The common theme is to identify and resolve self-reference in systems code, which is seen as the key challenge when teaching systems engineering, hence the name.

Selfie is a self-contained 64-bit, 12KLOC C implementation of:

1. a self-compiling compiler called starc that compiles a tiny but still fast language called C Star to a tiny and easy-to-teach subset of RISC-V,
2. a self-executing emulator called mipster that executes RISC-U code including itself when compiled with starc,
3. a self-hosting hypervisor called hypster that provides RISC-U virtual machines that can host all of selfie, that is, starc, mipster, and hypster itself, and
4. a tiny C* library called libcstar utilized by selfie.

Selfie is implemented in a single file and kept minimal for simplicity. There is also a simple in-memory linker, a RISC-U disassembler, a garbage collector, L1 instruction and data caches, a profiler, and a debugger with replay as well as minimal operating system support in the form of RISC-V system calls built into the emulator and hypervisor. The garbage collector is conservative and even self-collecting. It may operate as a library in the same address space as the mutator and/or as part of the emulator in the address space of the kernel.

Selfie generates ELF binaries that run on real hardware as well as on simulators and are compatible with the official RISC-V toolchain. Selfie is designed as a 64-bit system and requires a 64-bit system to run (LP64 data model). However, selfie also compiles on systems that support compiling and executing 32-bit binaries (ILP32 data model). In that case, selfie becomes a 32-bit system that generates and executes 32-bit binaries out-of-the-box. This is possible because the implementation of selfie carefully avoids 32-bit overflows throughout the system.

Extracted text: # Introduction

Fleet is GitOps at scale. Fleet is designed to manage multiple clusters. It's also lightweight enough that it works great for a single cluster too, but it really shines when you get to a large scale. By large scale, we mean either a lot of clusters, a lot of deployments, or a lot of teams in a single organization.

Fleet can manage deployments from git of raw Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, or Kustomize or any combination of the three. Regardless of the source, all resources are dynamically turned into Helm charts and Helm is used as the engine to deploy everything in the cluster. This gives a high degree of control, consistency, and auditability. Fleet focuses not only on the ability to scale but to give one a high degree of control and visibility to exactly what is installed on the cluster.

Extracted text: # Stargate

An open source data API gateway.

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a Cassandra database. For developers, it makes it easy to use Cassandra for any application workload by adding plugin support for new APIs, data types, and access methods - even secondary database models. Its built with extensibility as a first-class citizen to enable rapid innovation. For operators, Stargate introduces microservice architecture, allowing independent deployment and scale of storage nodes, API Service nodes, and coordinator nodes in Cassandra clusters.

We created Stargate because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With "read the manual" fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we started a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads?

This project enables customization of all aspects of data access and has modules for authentication, APIs, request handling / routing, and persistence backends. The current form is specific to Apache Cassandra (C*) compatible backends.

As shown in the figure below, Stargate is often deployed behind a load balancer or proxy and exposes multiple endpoints to client applications, including HTTP APIs, gRPC, and the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). Stargate sits in front of a Cassandra cluster which is used as the storage backend.

Humbug is a Mutation Testing framework for PHP. It is currently in development and so, while it does actually work quite well, it will have rough edges that a team of minions are working hard to hammer out. If it falls out of the gate, you have been warned ;).

Mutation Testing is, in a nutshell, giving your unit tests a run for their money. It involves injecting small defects into source code and then checking if the unit tests noticed. If they do, then your unit tests have "killed" the mutation. If not, the mutation has escaped detection. As unit tests are intended to prevent regressions, having a real regression pass unnoticed would be a bad thing!

Whereas Code Coverage can tell you what code your tests are executing, Mutation Testing is intended to help you judge how well your unit tests actually perform and where they could be improved.

SSToolkit was a grab bag of iOS goodies. It was a giant collection of classes that I started in 2008. This was getting out of hand. That version is completely deprecated.

Now SSToolkit is made up of several libraries you can use independently. SSToolkit is now just a header file and a with dependencies for each library. I don’t recommend using the pod.

Here’s what’s included:

* Clone of Safari's address bar from iOS 6.
* Simple badge view.
* Easy gradients in UIKit.
* Kinda okay HUD.
* UILabel with vertical alignment and text insets.
* Simple loading view.
* Determinate, circular progress view.
* Simple utility for only executing code every so often.
* Handy UITextField additions like insetting text.
* Add a placeholder to UITextView.
* Push UIWebView to its limits.
* A collection of useful Foundation and UIKit categories.

Several of these libraries have had big improvements since their abstraction from SSToolkit.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a vast archive of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Over the past few years, GEE has gained popularity in the geospatial community, empowering numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. Compared to the comprehensive JavaScript API and interactive IDE, the GEE Python API has relatively little documentation and limited functionality for visualizing results interactively. The geemap package enhances the Python API, enabling users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment.

KIF builds and performs the tests using a standard testing target. Testing is conducted synchronously in the main thread (running the run loop to force the passage of time) allowing for more complex logic and composition. This also allows KIF to take advantage of the Xcode Test Navigator, command line build tools, and Bot test reports.

KIF uses undocumented Apple APIs. This is true of most iOS testing frameworks, and is safe for testing purposes, but it's important that KIF does not make it into production code, as it will get your app submission denied by Apple.

- Description: Pytorch implementation of convolutional neural network visualization techniques

Extracted text: # Convolutional Neural Network Visualizations

This repository contains a number of convolutional neural network visualization techniques implemented in PyTorch. Note: I removed cv2 dependencies and moved the repository towards PIL. A few things might be broken (although I tested all methods), I would appreciate if you could create an issue if something does not work. The code in this repository was tested with torch version 0.4.1 and some of the functions may not work as intended in later versions. Although it shouldn't be too much of an effort to make it work, I have no plans at the moment to make the code in this repository compatible with the latest version because I'm still using 0.4.1. 

Depending on the technique, the code uses pretrained AlexNet or VGG from the model zoo. Some of the code also assumes that the layers in the model are separated into two sections; features, which contains the convolutional layers and classifier, that contains the fully connected layer (after flattening out convolutions). If you want to port this code to use it on your model that does not have such separation, you just need to do some editing on parts where it calls model.features and model.classifier. 

Every technique has its own python file (e.g. gradcam.py) which I hope will make things easier to understand. misc_functions.py contains functions like image processing and image recreation which is shared by the implemented techniques. All images are pre-processed with mean and std of the ImageNet dataset before being fed to the model. None of the code uses GPU as these operations are quite fast for a single image (except for deep dream because of the example image that is used for it is huge). You can make use of GPU with very little effort. The example pictures below include numbers in the brackets after the description, like Mastiff (243), this number represents the class id in the ImageNet dataset. 

I tried to comment on the code as much as possible, if you have any issues understanding it or porting it, don't hesitate to send an email or create an issue.

API Composition is a new pattern that allows you to interact with a heterogeneous set of APIs as if they were a single unified API. This not just eliminates a lot of glue code, but also allows you to reason about the API Dependencies of an application. WunderGraph can easily answer what APIs and Services your application depends on, providing analytics and observability into what APIs and Endpoints are used by your application and the quality of service your API dependencies provide.

Extracted text: GoReplay is an open-source network monitoring tool which can record your live traffic and use it for shadowing, load testing, monitoring and detailed analysis.

As your application grows, the effort required to test it also grows exponentially. GoReplay offers you the simple idea of reusing your existing traffic for testing, which makes it incredibly powerful. Our state of art technique allows you to analyze and record your application traffic without affecting it. This eliminates the risks that come with putting a third party component in the critical path. 

GoReplay increases your confidence in code deployments, configuration and infrastructure changes. GoReplay offers a unique approach for shadowing. Instead of being a proxy, GoReplay listens in the background for traffic on your network interfaces, requiring no changes in your production infrastructure, other than running GoReplay daemon on the same machine as your service.

While Plaid successfully achieved its goal, from an architecture point of view, it lacks all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app: with UI logic in Android classes, no tests and only one module. Plaid represents a great real world app example: it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities, it has technical debt, it has features that have to be dealt with as APIs are being removed. All of these problems are encountered by many projects in the Android community and therefore, make Plaid a suitable showcase for all the advantages that architecture components bring.

#### Data Science Immersive Capstone project

###### Project Motivation
Near the beginning of the galvanize DSI program I started a blog for myself. I wanted a place to help promote myself as I try to transition careers. A place to contribute my data science thoughts, and trip reports. Plus it also just seemed like it could be fun. My fledging blog still needs lots of work, but I do have a decent start on it.

###### Is it possible to identify elements that contribute to a successful blog?
While in the DSI program I was wondering if I could use some of my new data science skills to identify elements of a blog that can lead to its success. Of course I would never be able to identify everything that makes a blog do well. It would be hard to capture the visual appeal of a blog, and it would be almost impossible to capture aspects like self-promotion. That being said I thought it was possible to capture some aspects.

##### Project Overview and Workflow
To do this analysis a single topic of blogs was chosen to limit the effect of better topics doing significantly differently. The project involved gathering as many blogs as I felt like, for this I gathered 2500 blogs. Then much cleaning and some topic filtering took place. The problem is split into two sub problems, one to deal with identifying elements of successful posts, and one to identify elements of successful blogs.

The Derby MVC framework makes it easy to write realtime, collaborative applications that run in both Node.js and browsers.

Derby includes a powerful data synchronization engine called Racer that automatically syncs data among browsers, servers, and a database. Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications.

Derby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline.

Heap Explorer is a Memory Profiler, Debugger, and Analyzer for Unity. This repository hosts Heap Explorer for Unity 2019.3 and newer versions. For older versions, please visit the obsolete repository on Bitbucket instead.

I have spent a significant amount of time in the past identifying and fixing memory leaks, as well as searching for memory optimization opportunities in Unity applications. During this time, I often used Unity's Memory Profiler. While it's a useful tool, I was never entirely satisfied with it.

This led me to develop my own memory profiler, where I had the opportunity to address all the things I disliked about Unity's Memory Profiler and make them better. After much consideration about what to do with Heap Explorer, I concluded that the best option is to provide the source code and move on. Since then, I have provided occasional updates because several people still prefer Heap Explorer over Unity's Memory Profiler due to its easier-to-understand UI/UX.

I have also updated Heap Explorer to work with Unity 2019.3 and converted it into a Package, which means you should be able to use Heap Explorer for the entire 2019 LTS cycle, which ends in 2022.

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many tutorials about "headless WordPress" stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into advanced functionality because: headless WordPress is hard.

At WebDevStudios we believe that WordPress is so much more than a blog-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

This repo contains a command line tool for performing code reviews on git repositories.

## Overview

This tool is a distributed code review system for git repos.

By "distributed", we mean that code reviews are stored inside of the repository as git objects. Every developer on your team has their own copy of the review history that they can push or pull. When pulling, updates from the remote repo are automatically merged by the tool.

This design removes the need for any sort of server-side setup. As a result, this tool can work with any git hosting provider, and the only setup required is installing the client on your workstation.

Extracted text: # Introduction

Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.

* FASTER Log is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums.

* FASTER KV is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a fast non-blocking checkpointing technique that lets applications trade-off performance for commit latency.

Both FASTER KV and FASTER Log offer orders-of-magnitude higher performance than comparable solutions, on standard workloads.

Inspired by Mustache is a framework-agnostic way to render logic-free views. It emphasizes separating logic from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language.

Think of Mustache as a replacement for your views. Instead of views consisting of ERB or HAML with random helpers and arbitrary logic, your views are broken into two parts: a Ruby class and an HTML template. 

We call the Ruby class the "view" and the HTML template the "template." All your logic, decisions, and code is contained in your view. All your markup is contained in your template. The template does nothing but reference methods in your view. 

This strict separation makes it easier to write clean templates, easier to test your views, and more fun to work on your app's front end.

Extracted text: This repository is an overview of what you need to learn penetration testing and a collection of hacking tools, resources, and references to practice ethical hacking. Most of the tools are UNIX compatible, free, and open source.

## Introduction

### What is penetration testing?
Penetration testing is a type of security testing that is used to test the security of an application. It is conducted to find a security risk which might be present in a system. If a system is not secure, then an attacker may be able to disrupt or take unauthorized control of that system. A security risk is normally an accidental error that occurs while developing and implementing software, such as configuration errors, design errors, and software bugs.

### Want to become a penetration tester?
Knowing about risks on the internet and how they can be prevented is very useful, especially as a developer. Web hacking and penetration testing is the v2.0 of self-defense! A real penetration tester must be able to proceed rigorously and detect the weaknesses of an application. They must be able to identify the technology behind and test every single door that might be open to hackers.

This repository aims first to establish a reflection method on penetration testing and explain how to proceed to secure an application. Secondly, it regroups all kinds of tools or resources pen testers need. Be sure to know the basics of programming languages and internet security before learning pen testing. It is also important to inform yourself about the law and what you are allowed to do or not, as computer laws vary by country. Always check if what you're doing is legal, even when it's not offensive, as information gathering can also be illegal!

Extracted text: # future: Unified Parallel and Distributed Processing in R for Everyone

## Introduction

The purpose of the future package is to provide a very simple and uniform way of evaluating R expressions asynchronously using various resources available to the user.

In programming, a future is an abstraction for a value that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved. As soon as it is resolved, the value is available instantaneously. If the value is queried while the future is still unresolved, the current process is blocked until the future is resolved. It is possible to check whether a future is resolved or not without blocking. Exactly how and when futures are resolved depends on what strategy is used to evaluate them. For instance, a future can be resolved using a sequential strategy, which means it is resolved in the current R session. Other strategies may be to resolve futures asynchronously, for instance, by evaluating expressions in parallel on the current machine or concurrently on a compute cluster.

Futures provide a simple but yet powerful construct for parallel and/or distributed processing in R.

MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

- MongoDB: Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
- Express (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
- Angular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript

Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified.

As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. There are discussion forums on most MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered. Here I released these solutions, which are only for your reference purpose. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don’t copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It’s a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.

Spleeter is a source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses TensorFlow. It makes it easy to train source separation models (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources) and provides already trained state-of-the-art models for performing various flavors of separation:

* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation
* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation
* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation

2 stems and 4 stems models have been trained on the Musdb18 dataset. Spleeter is also very fast, as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.

We designed Spleeter so you can use it straight from the command line as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a library.

The deauthentication attack is the main feature, which can be used to disconnect devices from their WiFi network. Although this denial-of-service attack is nothing new, a lot of devices are still vulnerable to it. Luckily this is slowly changing with more WiFi 6 enabled devices being used. But a lot of outdated WiFi devices remain in place, for example in cheap IoT hardware. With an ESP8266 Deauther, you can easily test this attack on your 2.4GHz WiFi network/devices and see whether it’s successful or not. And if it is, you know you should upgrade your network.

wholeaked gets the file that will be shared and a list of recipients. It creates a unique signature for each recipient and adds it to the file secretly. After then, it can automatically send files to the corresponding recipients by using Sendgrid, AWS SES or SMTP integrations. Instead of sending them by e-mail, you can also share them manually.

wholeaked works with every file type. However, it has additional features for common file types such as PDF, DOCX, MOV etc.

To find who leaked the document, you just need to provide the leaked file to wholeaked, and it will reveal the responsible person by comparing the signatures in the database.

This algorithm was selected for its two major benefits over traditional deferred/tiled solutions: it allows for more freedom to choose forward or deferred shading paths as desired and is a better long-term fit for modern GPU performance trends.

Extracted text: # PHPMailer – A full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is `mail()`. However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms; however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server. PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and safer to use SMTP to localhost.

Please don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that you should look at before rolling your own.

Biological neural networks are able to control limbs in different scenarios, with high precision and robustness. As neural networks in living beings communicate through spikes, modern neuromorphic systems try to mimic them making use of spike-based neuron models. Liquid State Machines (LSM), a special type of Reservoir Computing system made of spiking units, when it was first introduced, had plasticity on an external layer and also through Short-Term Plasticity (STP) within the reservoir itself. However, most neuromorphic hardware currently available does not implement both Short-Term Depression and Facilitation and some of them don't support STP at all. In this work we test the impact of STP in an experimental way using a 2 degrees of freedom simulated robotic arm controlled by an LSM. Four trajectories are learned and their reproduction analysed with Dynamic Time Warping accumulated cost as the benchmark. The results from two different set-ups showed the use of STP in the reservoir was not computationally cost-effective for this particular robotic task.

Extracted text: # me_cleaner 

_mecleaner is a Python script able to modify an Intel ME firmware image with the final purpose of reducing its ability to interact with the system.

Intel ME is a co-processor integrated in all post-2006 Intel boards, which is the base hardware for many Intel features like Intel AMT, Intel Boot Guard, Intel PAVP and many others. To provide such features, it requires full access to the system, including memory (through DMA) and network access (transparent to the user).

Unlike many other firmware components, the Intel ME firmware can't be disabled or reimplemented, as it is tightly integrated into the boot process and is signed. This poses an issue for free firmware implementations and privacy-aware users, who are concerned about such firmware running on the lowest privilege ring on x86.

Before Nehalem (ME version 6, 2008/2009), the ME firmware could be removed completely from the flash chip by setting a couple of bits inside the flash descriptor. Starting from Nehalem, the Intel ME firmware can't be removed anymore; without a valid firmware, the PC shuts off forcefully after 30 minutes. However, it is still possible to modify its firmware to the point where Intel ME is active only during the boot process, effectively disabling it during normal operation, which is what _mecleaner tries to accomplish.

Extracted text: # cabi-predict

## Capital Bikeshare: Predictions of Near-Term Supply and Demand

This project is a demand and outage predictor for Capital Bikeshare. I take dock status and trip history, weather and calendar data, then fit a random forest regression model to estimate the customer demand for bikes and docks at each bikeshare station as a function of ten predictors:
- Time of Day
- Day of Week
- Day of Year
- Holiday (Y/N)
- Year
- Air Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation within the past hour
- Snow depth

I demonstrate this model with a customer-facing app that predicts CaBi demand and station outages in the immediate future. This app scrapes real-time dock status and weather data to form a feature vector, estimates customer demand for bikes and docks using the random forest, then computes outage probabilities with a Poisson model. Predictions are visualized on a map using leaflet.js. Result is published to a web app using Flask, hosted on heroku.

Scala combinator library for working with binary data.

The primary abstraction is a codec, which supports encoding a value of type A to a binary structure and decoding a binary structure to a value of type A. The codec objects provide a number of predefined codecs and combinators.

Automatic case class binding is supported via tuples. New codecs can be created by either implementing the codec trait, though typically new codecs are created by applying one or more combinators to existing codecs.

### Introduction

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning system for semantic image segmentation built on top of deep convolutional neural networks. It combines (1) atrous convolution to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed, (2) atrous spatial pyramid pooling to robustly segment objects at multiple scales, and (3) densely connected conditional random fields (CRF) as post processing. This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest research.

What happened to localtunnel? After pioneering instant public tunnels to localhost, many people copied the project and started businesses around the idea. Localtunnel fell into obscurity. Today, Alan Shreve's rightly dominates mindshare on the idea.

This repo now contains localtunnel v3, a very minimal implementation (under 200 lines) written in Go using my new project. Duplex lets you make stuff like localtunnel very easily. Although usable, there is no public server and the scope of the project is pretty fixed where it is.

This repo also continues to exist to archive the history of the project. You'll find several interesting branches here:

* (2011-2013) - Attempt to revitalize the project and service, v2 was written end-to-end in Python gevent and resolved many issues and requests from v1.
* (mid 2010) - The original implementation that became popular. It worked quite well, but was a dirty hack. It wrapped OpenSSH, with a client in Ruby and a control server in Python Twisted.
* (early 2010) - When I first had the idea, I tried using Python Twisted to implement the whole system. I didn't have the experience to get stream multiplexing to work, so this version is pretty broken.

- Description: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Extracted text: # Faiss

Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta's group.

Faiss contains several methods for similarity search. It assumes that the instances are represented as vectors and are identified by an integer, and that the vectors can be compared with L2 (Euclidean) distances or dot products. Vectors that are similar to a query vector are those that have the lowest L2 distance or the highest dot product with the query vector. It also supports cosine similarity, since this is a dot product on normalized vectors.

Some methods, like those based on binary vectors and compact quantization codes, solely use a compressed representation of the vectors and do not require keeping the original vectors. This generally comes at the cost of a less precise search but these methods can scale to billions of vectors in main memory on a single server. Other methods, like HNSW and NSG, add an indexing structure on top of the raw vectors to make searching more efficient.

The GPU implementation can accept input from either CPU or GPU memory. On a server with GPUs, the GPU indexes can be used as a drop-in replacement for the CPU indexes, and copies to/from GPU memory are handled automatically. Results will be faster if both input and output remain resident on the GPU. Both single and multi-GPU usage is supported.

Extracted text: is a Node server that acts as a local npm registry. It serves modules, caches them, and updates them whenever they change. Basically, it's a local mirror, but without having to replicate the entire npm registry.

This allows your commands to (mostly) work offline. Also, they get faster and faster over time, as commonly-installed modules are aggressively cached.

acts as a proxy between you and the main npm registry. You run commands like normal, but under the hood, all requests are sent through the local server.

When you first install a module, it will be fetched from the main npm registry. After that, the module and all its dependencies (at that version) are stored in a local database, so you can expect subsequent installs to be much faster.

The server will also listen for changes from the remote registry, so you can expect updates to a module's metadata to be replicated within seconds of being published. This means you won't get stuck with old versions.

If you're organizing a conference/meetup/whatever, you can also share this local server with multiple people. So if your teammates are constantly installing the same modules over and over again, this can save a lot of time in the long run.

is also a good way to make npm work offline. Assuming new versions of a package haven't been published since you last installed, subsequent installs will all serve from the cache, without ever hitting a remote server.

- Description: Turn your two-bit doodles into fine artworks with deep neural networks, generate seamless textures from photos, transfer style from one image to another, perform example-based upscaling, but wait... there's more! (An implementation of Semantic Style Transfer.)

Extracted text: Neural Doodle
=============
Use a deep neural network to borrow the skills of real artists and turn your two-bit doodles into masterpieces! This project is an implementation of a style transfer algorithm based on the work of Champandard (2016) and Li (2016). The script generates a new image by using one, two, three, or four images as inputs, depending on what you're trying to do: the original style and its annotation, and a target content image (optional) with its annotation (a.k.a. your doodle). The algorithm extracts annotated patches from the style image and incrementally transfers them over to the target image based on how closely they match.

### GAS Intro
GameplayAbilities are like the abilities you have in Dota or equivalent games. You can cast a fireball that hits a player, explodes, and sets everyone in the radius on fire, while the player who cast it loses some mana and is put on cooldown. 

Using Epic's GameplayAbility plugin can help implement these features, although it may be complex to understand initially. GameplayAbilities are beneficial for games needing a powerful skill, buff, and attribute system that is easy to extend and efficient to replicate, making them suitable for multiplayer RPGs or MOBAs. However, they may not be ideal for every game due to their complexity and size.

GameplayAbilities is a code module that was integrated into UE4's source but has since been moved into a separate plugin. It is not fully documented and may require familiarity with C++ in the context of UE4 to navigate effectively. This guide aims to assist users in understanding and utilizing the system.

Draper adds an object-oriented layer of presentation logic to your Rails application.

Without Draper, this functionality might have been tangled up in procedural helpers or adding bulk to your models. With Draper decorators, you can wrap your models with presentation-related logic to organise - and test - this layer of your app much more effectively. 

Imagine your application has a model. With Draper, you create a corresponding decorator that wraps the model and deals only with presentational concerns. In the view, you can use the decorator in exactly the same way as you would have used the model. Whenever you start needing logic in the view or start thinking about a helper method, you can implement a method on the decorator instead. 

Ruby thrives when we use Object-Oriented style. Without a decorator, you would have to implement presentation-centric methods in the model, which does not belong there. Instead, you implement a decorator, allowing for a more organized and testable approach to presentation logic. 

Decorators are the ideal place to:
* format complex data for user display
* define commonly-used representations of an object
* mark up attributes with semantic HTML

What is this?

1. A combination of the rsync algorithm and content-addressable storage
2. An efficient way to store and retrieve multiple related versions of large file systems or directory trees
3. An efficient way to deliver and update OS, VM, IoT and container images over the Internet in an HTTP and CDN friendly way
4. An efficient backup system

Encoding: Lets take a large linear data stream, split it into variable-sized chunks, and store these chunks in individual, compressed files in some directory, each file named after a strong hash value of its contents. This directory is called a "chunk store". A "chunk index" file is generated that lists these chunk hash values plus their respective chunk sizes. The chunking algorithm is designed to create variable, but similarly sized chunks from the data stream.

Decoding: Lets take the chunk index file, and reassemble the large linear data stream by concatenating the uncompressed chunks retrieved from the chunk store.

As an extra twist, we introduce a well-defined, reproducible, random-access serialization format for directory trees to permit efficient, stable storage of complete directory trees in the system.

Why bother with all of this? Streams with similar contents will result in mostly the same chunk files in the chunk store, minimizing disk usage. Moreover, when transferring linear data streams, chunks already known on the receiving side can be reused, minimizing network traffic.

Why is this different from other tools? One major difference is that we remove file boundaries before chunking, allowing us to recognize similarities in files and directories beyond file boundaries.

The "chunking" algorithm is based on the buzhash rolling hash function. SHA512/256 is used as a strong hash function to generate digests of the chunks, and zstd is used to compress the individual chunks. 

Is this new? Conceptually, not too much. This uses well-known concepts, implemented in a variety of other projects, and puts them together in a moderately new way. The primary influences are rsync and git.

Extracted text: # ImplicitCAD: Math Inspired CAD

## Introduction

ImplicitCAD is a programmatic CAD program, implemented in Haskell. Unlike traditional CAD programs, programmatic CAD programs use text descriptions of objects, as in programming. Concepts like variables, control structures and abstraction are used, just as in programming. This provides a number of advantages:

 - Objects can be abstracted and reused
 - Repetitive tasks can be automated
 - Objects can be designed parametrically
 - The usual tools for software development (like version control) can be used

The traditional example of programmatic CAD is OpenSCAD.

Generally, objects in programmatic CAD are built with Constructive Solid Geometry or CSG. Unions, intersections and differences of simpler shapes slowly build the object. ImplicitCAD supports all this and much more! For example, it provides rounded unions so that one can have smooth interfaces between objects.

It also directly provides some GCode generation, and has a parser for OpenSCAD to make it easier for people to transition/use.

ImplicitCAD is very much a work in progress. The author considers it ready for beta testers and greatly appreciates bug reports.

The target audience for this specification is not the client developer, but those who have, or are actively interested in, building their own GraphQL implementations and tools.

In order to be broadly adopted, GraphQL will have to target a wide variety of backend environments, frameworks, and languages, which will necessitate a collaborative effort across projects and organizations. This specification serves as a point of coordination for this effort.

mason-lspconfig bridges mason.nvim with the lspconfig plugin - making it easier to use both plugins together.

It closes some gaps that exist between mason.nvim and nvim-lspconfig. Its main responsibilities are to:

- register a setup hook with mason.nvim that ensures servers installed with mason are set up with the necessary configuration
- provide extra convenience APIs such as the install command
- allow you to (i) automatically install, and (ii) automatically set up a predefined list of servers
- translate between LSP server names and mason package names

It is recommended to use this extension if you use mason.nvim and nvim-lspconfig (it's strongly recommended for Windows users).

  Z    | current position in the file
 [...] | additional sections (warning/errors/statistics) from external plugins (e.g. YCM, syntastic, ...)

Extracted text: EdgeDB is a new kind of database that takes the best parts of relational databases, graph databases, and ORMs. We call it a graph-relational database.

Schema is the foundation of your application. It should be something you can read, write, and understand. Forget foreign keys; tabular data modeling is a relic of an older age. Instead, EdgeDB thinks about schema the same way you do: as object types containing properties connected by links.

EdgeDB supports everything you would expect from your database: a strict type system, indexes, constraints, computed properties, stored procedures, and more. It also offers new features like link properties, schema mixins, and best-in-class JSON support.

EdgeDB's super-powered query language, EdgeQL, is designed as a ground-up redesign of SQL. EdgeQL queries produce rich, structured objects, not flat lists of rows, making it easy to fetch related objects without the need for JOINs. EdgeQL queries are composable, allowing for subqueries and nested mutations.

While EdgeDB solves the same problems as ORM libraries, it is a full-fledged database with a comprehensive standard library, computed properties, polymorphic queries, blocks, transactions, and much more. The goal is to rethink every aspect of how developers model, migrate, manage, and query their database.

Extracted text: # Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression

This repository contains the implementation code for the paper: __Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression__, presented at the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2021).

Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) aims to learn from imbalanced data with continuous targets, tackle potential missing data for certain regions, and generalize to the entire target range.

Existing techniques for learning from imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., the targets are different classes. However, many real-world tasks involve continuous and even infinite target values. We systematically investigate Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR), which aims to learn continuous targets from natural imbalanced data, deal with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalize to the entire target range.

We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets for common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains, ranging from single-value prediction such as age, text similarity score, health condition score, to dense-value prediction such as depth.

* does not create a copy of the original bitmap
* does not use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased
* does not use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas

Also has proper support for:
* Borders (with Colors and ColorStateLists)

## About

This is a starter boilerplate app I've put together using the following technologies:

* Isomorphic rendering
* Both client and server make calls to load data from separate API server
* ES6 and ES7 magic
* Bundling
* Redux/React Router bindings
* Consistent code style
* Form state management in Redux
* Speed up form validation
* Combine single reducers into one key-based reducer
* Import stylesheets in plain css, sass, and less
* Customize Bootstrap and FontAwesome
* Manage title and meta tag information on both server and client
* Allow require() to work for statics both on client and server
* Write unit tests for the project

I cobbled this together from a wide variety of similar "starter" repositories. As I post this in June 2015, all of these libraries are right at the bleeding edge of web development. They may fall out of fashion as quickly as they have come into it, but I personally believe that this stack is the future of web development and will survive for several years. I'm building my new projects like this, and I recommend that you do, too.

This document covers how to use browserify to build modular applications.

browserify is a tool for compiling commonjs modules for the browser.

You can use browserify to organize your code and use third-party libraries even if you don't use it itself in any other capacity except for bundling and installing packages with npm.

The module system that browserify uses is the same as node, so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too.

Increasingly, people are publishing modules to npm which are intentionally designed to work in both node and in the browser using browserify, and many packages on npm are intended for use in just the browser.

- Description: a javascript static security analysis tool

Extracted text: Introduction
===============  
Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple: JavaScript has now been accepted as the mainstream programming for applications, whether on the web or mobile, client-side or server-side. JavaScript's flexibility and loose typing allow developers to create rich applications at an unbelievable speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters have almost eliminated scalability and throughput concerns for many organizations. JavaScript is now a powerful language with growing usage, evolving from client-side code in web applications to server-side through Node.JS, and is supported as a proper language for major mobile operating systems.

However, many developers practice insecure coding, leading to client-side attacks, with DOM XSS being the most infamous. We identified that the root cause of this problem is the lack of practically usable tools to address real-world issues. As our first attempt to solve this problem, we present JSPrime: A JavaScript static analysis tool that is lightweight and easy to use. The tool is based on the popular Esprima ECMAScript parser.

Description
===============  
JSPrime offers several interesting features, including:
- JS Library Aware Source & Sinks
- Variable & Function Tracing
- Variable & Function Scope Aware analysis
- Known filter function awareness
- OOP & Prototype Compliance
- Minimum False Positive alerts
- Support for minified JavaScript
- Blazing fast performance
- Point and Click interface

Upcoming features include automatic code de-obfuscation and ECMAScript family support.

BPF, as in Berkeley Packet Filter, is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space. Initially implemented on BSD, then Linux, the (now legacy) "classic BPF" or cBPF machine would be used with tools like tcpdump for filtering packets in the kernel to avoid useless copies to user space. More recently, the BPF infrastructure in Linux has been completely reworked and gave life to the "extended BPF", or eBPF, which gained new features (safety and termination checks, JIT-compiling for programs, persistent maps, a standard library, hardware offload support, etc.) and is now used for many tasks. Processing packets at a very low level (XDP), tracing and monitoring events on the system, or enforcing access control over cgroups are but a few examples to which eBPF brings performance, programmability and flexibility.

## What is Seata?

A distributed transaction solution with high performance and ease of use for microservices architecture.

### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices

In a traditional monolithic application, data consistency is guaranteed by local transactions. However, in a microservices architecture, where services operate on different data sources, maintaining data consistency across the entire business logic becomes challenging.

### How Seata Works

Seata addresses this problem by defining a Distributed Transaction as a Global Transaction composed of multiple Branch Transactions, which are typically Local Transactions. The Seata Framework includes three roles: Transaction Coordinator (TC), Transaction Manager (TM), and Resource Manager (RM), each responsible for different aspects of transaction management. 

A typical lifecycle of a Seata-managed distributed transaction involves initiating a global transaction, propagating an identifier (XID), registering local transactions as branches, and committing or rolling back the global transaction as needed.

This project was started to bring the beauty and ease-of-use of Bootstrap to jQuery UI widgets. 

Bootstrap is one of our favorite projects, but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things:

* The ability to work side-by-side with jQuery UI (something which caused a number of widgets to break visually)
* The ability to theme jQuery UI widgets using Bootstrap styles. Whilst we love jQuery UI, we find some of the current themes to look a little dated. Our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same.

To clarify, this project doesn't aim or intend to replace Bootstrap. It merely provides a jQuery UI-compatible theme inspired by Bootstrap's design. It also provides a version of Bootstrap CSS with a few (minor) sections commented out which enable the theme to work alongside it. 

We welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible.

#### YALFoldingTabBar
YALFoldingTabBar is a subclass of a standard UIView. We wanted to make this component expand and contract in response to a user tapping. When the component is closed you can only see a central button (“+”). When tapping on it, our custom Tab Bar expands letting other tabBarItems appear, so that the user can switch the controllers.

Each separate tabBarItem can have two additional buttons on the left and right. These buttons can be used to let a user interact with a selected screen on the YALFoldingTabBarController without even having to leave it.

It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd is gradient-based optimization.
