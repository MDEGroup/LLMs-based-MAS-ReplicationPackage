- Description: A type-safe typescript SQL query builder
[Extractor sent]: Kysely (pronounce “Key-Seh-Lee”) is a type-safe and autocompletion-friendly TypeScript SQL query builder. Kysely ensures you only refer to tables and columns that are visible to the part of the query you're writing. The result type only has the selected columns with correct types and aliases, providing autocompletion for all that information. Kysely can infer column names, aliases, and types from selected subqueries, joined subqueries, and more. It also offers escape hatches for cases where things cannot be typed at compile time. All API documentation is available in the typing files, and you can access it in your IDE.

- Description: DEPRECATED: A rich text editor framework for the web platform
[Extractor sent]: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED - You can find more information about this in our blog post. In summary:

- We have no plans to add features to Scribe but may make critical updates throughout the period that we continue to use instances of Scribe internally.
- We recommend forking the project in order to do any feature work as we will not be moving the Scribe repository out of the Guardian organisation.
- In time we hope to be able to open source the new text editor we are working on.

# Scribe

A rich text editor framework for the web platform, with patches for browser inconsistencies and sensible defaults.

## Description

Please note: There is a lot of missing documentation for Scribe and many of its plugins. We plan to improve this, however in the meantime we encourage you to look at the code. Scribe is very small in comparison to other libraries of its kind.

Extracted text: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED - You can find more information about this in our blog post. In summary:

- We have no plans to add features to Scribe but may make critical updates throughout the period that we continue to use instances of Scribe internally.
- We recommend forking the project in order to do any feature work as we will not be moving the Scribe repository out of the Guardian organisation.
- In time we hope to be able to open source the new text editor we are working on.

# Scribe

A rich text editor framework for the web platform, with patches for browser inconsistencies and sensible defaults.

- Description: A command-line installer for Windows.
[Extractor sent]: Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows.

Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:

- Eliminates permission popup windows
- Hides GUI wizard-style installers
- Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs
- Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
- Finds and installs dependencies automatically
- Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program

Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like. If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer — you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it. 

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory. Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers). Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts.

[Extractor sent]: ## About Pinpoint

Pinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Inspired by various concepts, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.

You should definitely check Pinpoint out if you want to:

* Understand your application at a glance
* Monitor your application in real-time
* Gain code-level visibility to every transaction
* Install APM Agents without changing a single line of code
* Have minimal impact on performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)

## Overview

Services nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a black box. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.

- Description: Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds
[Extractor sent]: # Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds

This repository is code release for our ICCV 2019 paper. 

Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data, we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images.

In this repository, we provide VoteNet model implementation (with Pytorch) as well as data preparation, training and evaluation scripts on SUN RGB-D and ScanNet.

[Extractor sent]: Synopse mORMot 1 Framework

An Open Source Client-Server ORM/SOA framework (c) 2008-2023 Synopse Informatique

Synopse mORMot is an Open Source Client-Server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 6 up to the latest Delphi and FPC revisions, targeting Windows/Linux for servers, and any platform for clients (including mobile or AJAX).

The main features of mORMot are therefore:

- ORM/ODM: objects persistence on almost any database (SQL or NoSQL);
- SOA: organize your business logic into REST services;
- Clients: consume your data or services from any platform, via ORM/SOA APIs;
- Web MVC: publish your ORM/SOA process as responsive Web Applications.

With local or remote access, via an auto-configuring Client-Server REST design.

Due to its modular design, switch from a Client-Server architecture over HTTP, named pipes or GDI messages into a stand-alone application is just a matter of mORMot classes initialization. For instance, the very same executable can even be running stand-alone, as a server, as a service, or a client, depending on some run-time parameters!

Emphasizing simplicity, speed and versatility, mORMot is an incredibly well-documented Open Source project easy enough to add basic ORM or Client-Server features to simple applications for hobbyists, or let experienced users develop scaling and strong service-based projects for their customers, with the advantages of native code and easy-to-deploy solutions, reducing deployment cost and increasing ROI.

Welcome to my Capstone Project. This README provides instructions about the documentation and code related to the project. The capstone project report is available as capstone_report.pdf, which offers a complete guide to the steps followed to complete the project. Accompanying the report is a Jupyter notebook, capstone_report.ipynb, that contains all the Python code used in the project. The notebook allows access to all results by running the cells, and it is also available in exported HTML format for convenience. 

I used standard libraries, specifically numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats. The data folder contains both JSON and CSV versions of the data samples used for the report.

slog-rs is an ecosystem of reusable components for structured, extensible, composable, and contextual logging for Rust. The ambition is to be The Logging Library for Rust, accommodating a variety of logging features and requirements. If there is a feature that you need and the standard crate is missing, slog-rs should have it.

This power comes with a little steeper learning curve, so if you experience any problems, please join the community to get up to speed. While the code is reliable, the documentation sometimes could use an improvement. Please report all issues and ideas.
