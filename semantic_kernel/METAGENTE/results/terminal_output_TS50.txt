- Description: A type-safe typescript SQL query builder
Extracted text: Kysely (pronounce “Key-Seh-Lee”) is a type-safe and autocompletion-friendly TypeScript SQL query builder. Kysely makes sure you only refer to tables and columns that are visible to the part of the query you're writing. The result type only has the selected columns with correct types and aliases, and you get autocompletion for all that. Kysely is able to infer column names, aliases, and types from selected subqueries, joined subqueries, and more. It also offers escape hatches for cases where things cannot be typed at compile time. All API documentation is written in the typing files, allowing you to see it in your IDE.

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data from delimited files, such as comma-separated values (CSV) and tab-separated values (TSV). It is designed to parse many types of data found in the wild, while providing an informative problem report when parsing leads to unexpected results. If you are new to readr, the best place to start is the in R for Data Science.

New Summarizer Prompt: Summarize the following extracted text from a Github repository README into a concise term or phrase that captures the key concept or purpose of the repository. Prioritize using existing taglines, functional descriptions, purpose statements, or overviews from the beginning of the text, especially if they directly mention reading operations or specific file types such as CSV, TSV, or other flat file formats. If these terms are present at the beginning of the text, ensure they are prioritized in the description. Additionally, if the text highlights reading flat files into a specific environment like R, make sure to incorporate this information into the description. The output should clearly and accurately reflect the repository's primary function or purpose, emphasizing reading operations or file types like CSV, TSV, and other flat file formats mentioned in the text. If a specific statement or phrase in the text closely matches the repository's function, use that in the description.

- Description: DEPRECATED: A rich text editor framework for the web platform
Extracted text: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED - You can find more information about this in our blog post. In summary:

- We have no plans to add features to Scribe but may make critical updates throughout the period that we continue to use instances of Scribe internally.
- We recommend forking the project in order to do any feature work as we will not be moving the Scribe repository out of the Guardian organisation.
- In time we hope to be able to open source the new text editor we are working on.

# Scribe

A rich text editor framework for the web platform, with patches for browser inconsistencies and sensible defaults.

## Description

Please note: There is a lot of missing documentation for Scribe and many of its plugins. We plan to improve this, however in the meantime we encourage you to look at the code. Scribe is very small in comparison to other libraries of its kind.

- Description: A command-line installer for Windows.
Extracted text: Scoop is a command-line installer for Windows.

Scoop installs programs from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It:

- Eliminates permission popup windows
- Hides GUI wizard-style installers
- Prevents PATH pollution from installing lots of programs
- Avoids unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
- Finds and installs dependencies automatically
- Performs all the extra setup steps itself to get a working program

Scoop is very scriptable, so you can run repeatable setups to get your environment just the way you like. If you've built software that you'd like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer — you just need to zip your program and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it.

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory. Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers). Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and PowerShell scripts.

Extracted text: ## About Pinpoint

Pinpoint is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java. Inspired by various concepts, Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.

You should definitely check Pinpoint out if you want to:

* Understand your application at a glance
* Monitor your application in real-time
* Gain code-level visibility to every transaction
* Install APM Agents without changing a single line of code
* Have minimal impact on performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)

## Overview

Services nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a black box. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.

You should definitely check Pinpoint out if you want to:

* Understand your application at a glance
* Monitor your application in real-time
* Gain code-level visibility to every transaction
* Install APM Agents without changing a single line of code
* Have minimal impact on performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)

## Overview

Services nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a black box. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.

Gocode is a helper tool which is intended to be integrated with your source code editor, like vim, neovim and emacs. It provides several advanced capabilities, which currently includes:

- Context-sensitive autocompletion

It is called daemon, because it uses client/server architecture for caching purposes. In particular, it makes autocompletions very fast. Typical autocompletion time with warm cache is 30ms, which is barely noticeable.

- Description: Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds
Extracted text: # Deep Hough Voting for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds

## Introduction
This repository is code release for our ICCV 2019 paper. Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data, we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images.

In this repository, we provide VoteNet model implementation (with Pytorch) as well as data preparation, training and evaluation scripts on SUN RGB-D and ScanNet.

- Description: Synopse mORMot 1 ORM/SOA/MVC framework - Please upgrade to mORMot 2 !
Extracted text: Synopse mORMot 1 Framework

An Open Source Client-Server ORM/SOA framework (c) 2008-2023 Synopse Informatique.

Synopse mORMot is an Open Source Client-Server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 6 up to the latest Delphi and FPC revisions, targeting Windows/Linux for servers, and any platform for clients (including mobile or AJAX).

The main features of mORMot are therefore:

- ORM/ODM: objects persistence on almost any database (SQL or NoSQL);
- SOA: organize your business logic into REST services;
- Clients: consume your data or services from any platform, via ORM/SOA APIs;
- Web MVC: publish your ORM/SOA process as responsive Web Applications.

With local or remote access, via an auto-configuring Client-Server REST design.

Due to its modular design, switch from a Client-Server architecture over HTTP, named pipes or GDI messages into a stand-alone application is just a matter of mORMot classes initialization. For instance, the very same executable can even be running stand-alone, as a server, as a service, or a client, depending on some run-time parameters!

Emphasizing simplicity, speed and versatility, mORMot is an incredibly well-documented Open Source project easy enough to add basic ORM or Client-Server features to simple applications for hobbyists, or let experienced users develop scaling and strong service-based projects for their customers, with the advantages of native code and easy-to-deploy solutions, reducing deployment cost and increasing ROI.

Synopse mORMot is an Open Source Client-Server ORM SOA MVC framework for Delphi 6 up to the latest Delphi and FPC revisions, targeting Windows/Linux for servers, and any platform for clients (including mobile or AJAX).

The main features of mORMot are therefore:

- ORM/ODM: objects persistence on almost any database (SQL or NoSQL);
- SOA: organize your business logic into REST services;
- Clients: consume your data or services from any platform, via ORM/SOA APIs;
- Web MVC: publish your ORM/SOA process as responsive Web Applications.

With local or remote access, via an auto-configuring Client-Server REST design.

Due to its modular design, switch from a Client-Server architecture over HTTP, named pipes or GDI messages into a stand-alone application is just a matter of mORMot classes initialization. For instance, the very same executable can even be running stand-alone, as a server, as a service, or a client, depending on some run-time parameters!

Emphasizing simplicity, speed and versatility, mORMot is an incredibly well-documented Open Source project easy enough to add basic ORM or Client-Server features to simple applications for hobbyists, or let experienced users develop scaling and strong service-based projects for their customers, with the advantages of native code and easy-to-deploy solutions, reducing deployment cost and increasing ROI.
