Extracted text: Bolts is a collection of low-level libraries designed to make developing mobile apps easier. Bolts was designed by Parse and Facebook for our own internal use, and we have decided to open source these libraries to make them available to others. Using these libraries does not require using any Parse services, nor do they require having a Parse or Facebook developer account.

Bolts includes:

* "Tasks", which make organization of complex asynchronous code more manageable. A task is kind of like a JavaScript Promise, but available for iOS and Android.
* An implementation of App Links, helping you link to content in other apps and handle incoming deep-links.

Extracted text: # SpecuCheck

SpecuCheck is a Windows utility for checking the state of the software and hardware mitigations against CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown), CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre v2), CVE-2018-3260 (Foreshadow), and CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre v4). It uses two new information classes that were added to the NtQuerySystemInformation API call as part of the recent patches introduced in January 2018 and reports the data as seen by the Windows Kernel.

On January 3rd 2018, Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings, as well as a number of OS Vendors reported a series of vulnerabilities that were discovered by Google Project Zero:

* Variant 1: bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753)
* Variant 2: branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715)
* Variant 3: rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754)

Microsoft released patches for Windows 7 SP1 and higher later that same day. These patches, depending on architecture, OS version, boot settings and a number of hardware-related properties, apply a number of software and hardware mitigations against these issues. The enablement state of these mitigations, their availability, and configuration is stored by the Windows kernel in a number of global variables, and exposed to user-mode callers through an undocumented system call.

Additionally, new side channel attacks were reported, such as Spectre Variant 4: speculative store bypass (CVE-2018-3639) and Foreshadow: L1 terminal fault (CVE-2018-3620) which were fixed in Windows 7 SP1 and higher with patches in August's Patch Tuesday.

SpecuCheck takes advantage of this system call in order to confirm if a system has indeed been patched (non-patched systems will fail the call) and what the status of the mitigations are, which can be used to determine potential performance pitfalls.

Bender is an abstraction layer over MetalPerformanceShaders useful for working with neural networks. It is of growing interest in the AI environment to execute neural networks on mobile devices even if the training process has been done previously. We want to make it easier for everyone to execute pretrained networks on iOS.

Bender allows you to easily define and run neural networks using the most common layers like Convolution, Pooling, FullyConnected and some normalizations among others. It is also flexible in the way it receives the parameters for these layers.

We also want to support loading models trained on other frameworks such as TensorFlow or Caffe2. Currently, Bender includes an adapter for TensorFlow that loads a graph with variables and "translates" it to Bender layers. This feature supports a subset of TensorFlow's operations but we plan to enhance it to cover more cases.

CSS can be used for document text styling — for example, changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

Brackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that's built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?

* Tools shouldn't clutter your coding environment with lots of panels and icons; the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts context-specific code and tools inline.
* Brackets is in sync with your browser. With Live Preview, Brackets works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.
* Do it yourself. Because Brackets is open source and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can customize it to be the best code editor for the web.

Brackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas that we are anxious to add and other innovative web development workflows that we are planning to build into Brackets. So take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor.

This is beta-quality software: feature-complete and stable but probably with a few bugs or missing features. 

The goal of this project is to deliver on XMPP's original vision: create a modern open platform for federated instant messaging with an emphasis on mobile communication. A secondary goal is to create a decentralized IM platform that is much harder to track and block by the governments.

Extracted text: QR Code generator library

Introduction

This project aims to be the best, clearest QR Code generator library in multiple languages. The primary goals are flexible options and absolute correctness. Secondary goals are compact implementation size and good documentation comments.

Description

Core features:

* Available in 6 programming languages, all with nearly equal functionality: Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Rust, C++, C
* Significantly shorter code but more documentation comments compared to competing libraries
* Supports encoding all 40 versions (sizes) and all 4 error correction levels, as per the QR Code Model 2 standard
* Output format: Raw modules/pixels of the QR symbol
* Detects finder-like penalty patterns more accurately than other implementations
* Encodes numeric and special-alphanumeric text in less space than general text
* Open-source code under the permissive MIT License

Manual parameters:

### A Very High Performance Objective-C JSON Library

JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, is a lightweight, text-based, serialization format for structured data that is used by many web-based services and APIs. JSON provides the following primitive types:

* Null
* Boolean
* Number
* String
* Array
* Object (a.k.a. Associative Arrays, Key / Value Hash Tables, Maps, Dictionaries, etc.)

JSONKit uses Core Foundation internally, and it is assumed that Core Foundation is equivalent to Foundation for every equivalent base type. The default behavior for JSONKit is strict conformance to the JSON specification, ensuring that JSON is encoded in Unicode. JSONKit will not accept JSON that contains ill-formed Unicode.

Extracted text: # Gardener

Gardener implements the automated management and operation of clusters as a service and provides a fully validated extensibility framework that can be adjusted to any programmatic cloud or infrastructure provider.

Gardener is 100% Kubernetes-native and exposes its own Cluster API to create homogeneous clusters on all supported infrastructures. This API harmonizes not only how to get to clusters but also the make-up of the clusters themselves, ensuring homogeneous clusters with the same bill of material, configuration, and behavior across all supported infrastructures.

Gardener's main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks. It introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (called garden cluster) for managing end-user Kubernetes clusters (called shoot clusters). These shoot clusters are described via specifications observed by controllers that manage their lifecycle, including bringing up the clusters, reconciling their state, and performing automated updates.

To ensure high quality of service, Gardener controls the main components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, API server, controller manager, scheduler) hosted in Kubernetes clusters themselves (called seed clusters). This architecture, referred to as kubeception or inception design, reduces total cost of ownership and simplifies "day-2 operations" by utilizing mature Kubernetes features.

Gardener reuses the identical Kubernetes design to span a scalable multi-cloud and multi-cluster landscape, easing the initial learning curve and accelerating developer productivity.

This makes testing very easy because no logic lives in the View (Activity, Fragment) except for fancy animations which anyways aren't testable.

Extracted text: # orjson

orjson is a fast, correct JSON library for Python. It is the fastest Python library for JSON and is more correct than the standard json library or other third-party libraries. It serializes datetime, date, time, and UUID instances natively.

Its features and drawbacks compared to other Python JSON libraries include:

* Serializes datetime instances 40-50x as fast as other libraries
* Serializes date, time, and UUID instances to RFC 3339 format, e.g., "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"
* Serializes date instances 4-12x as fast with 0.3x the memory usage of other libraries
* Pretty prints 10x to 20x as fast as the standard library
* Serializes to bytes rather than str, i.e., is not a drop-in replacement
* Serializes strings without escaping unicode to ASCII, e.g., "\xe5\xa5\xbd" rather than "u597d"
* Serializes subclasses of datetime, date, time, and UUID natively, requiring options to specify how to serialize others
* Has strict UTF-8 conformance, more correct than the standard library
* Has strict JSON conformance in not supporting NaN/Infinity/-Infinity
* Does not provide read or write functions for file-like objects

orjson supports CPython 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. It distributes wheels for various architectures and operating systems. orjson does not support PyPy or PEP 554 subinterpreters. Releases follow semantic versioning, and serializing a new object type without an opt-in flag is considered a breaking change.

orjson is licensed under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses.

C++ remains the dominant programming language for performance-critical software, with massive and growing codebases and investments. However, it is struggling to improve and meet developers' needs, largely due to accumulating decades of technical debt. Incrementally improving C++ is challenging, both because of the technical debt itself and the difficulties with its evolution process. The best way to address these problems is to avoid inheriting the legacy of C or C++ directly and instead start with solid language foundations like modular code organization and consistent, simple syntax.

Existing modern languages provide an excellent developer experience, but their designs present significant barriers to adoption and migration from C++. Carbon is fundamentally a successor language approach, designed around interoperability with C++ and large-scale adoption for existing C++ codebases and developers. 

Carbon aims to match C++ performance, ensure seamless interoperability, provide a gentle learning curve for C++ developers, and support scalable migration from C++. The project is focused on performance-critical software, language evolution, readability, practical safety, and fast development, while also emphasizing interoperability with existing C++ code.

The facets project contains two visualizations for understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets: Facets Overview and Facets Dive. The visualizations are implemented as web components and can be easily embedded into Jupyter notebooks or webpages.

## Facets Overview

Overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. It produces a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis and can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets. The tool can process both numeric and string features, including multiple instances of a number or string per feature. Overview can help uncover issues with datasets, including unexpected feature values, missing feature values for a large number of examples, and training/test/validation set skew. Key aspects of the visualization are outlier detection and distribution comparison across multiple datasets.

## Facets Dive

Dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details. Each example is represented as a single item in the visualization, and the points can be positioned by faceting/bucketing in multiple dimensions by their feature values. Combining smooth animation and zooming with faceting and filtering, Dive makes it easy to spot patterns and outliers in complex data sets.

Yasumi (Japanese for Holiday「休み」) is the easy PHP library that helps you retrieve the dates and names of holidays and other special celebrations from various countries/states. It is calculation and rule driven, avoiding the need for a comprehensive database.

Many services exist that can provide holiday information; however, they are either not entirely free or only offer limited information. In addition, no exhaustive PHP library exists today covering a wide range of holidays and countries. 

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible. Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e., by country/state), making it easy to add new holiday providers that calculate holidays.

Extracted text: # SeaweedFS

SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives:

1. to store billions of files!
2. to serve the files fast!

SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation).

There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file's metadata. It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases.

On top of the object store, an optional Filer can support directories and POSIX attributes. Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc.

SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud, achieving both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity.

* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future.

- Description: A Git-compatible DVCS that is both simple and powerful

Extracted text: # Jujutsu—a version control system

## Introduction

Jujutsu is a powerful version control system for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use. It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user interface and version control algorithms from the storage systems used to serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical backends, that may have their own data or networking models.

Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content, making it compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools. All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.

We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:

- Git: We make an effort to be fast—with a snappy UX, efficient algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for "physical storage", for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.

- Mercurial & Sapling: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as the revset language to select commits. There is no explicit index or staging area. Branches are "anonymous" like Mercurial, so you don’t need to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are powerful and simple.

- Pijul & Darcs: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as first-class objects in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs. While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs and Pijul, the effect is that many forms of conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.

And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:

- Working-copy-as-a-commit: Changes to files are recorded automatically as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This "snapshot" design simplifies the user-facing data model.

- Operation log & undo: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the repository, making debugging easier, especially when helping others with their repositories. 

- Automatic rebase and conflict resolution: When you modify a commit, every descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one, making "patch-based" workflows easier.

- Safe, concurrent replication: Jujutsu is designed to be safe under concurrent scenarios, allowing for safe storage of version-controlled repositories in various environments. 

The command-line tool is called "jj" for now because it's easy to type and easy to replace. The project is called "Jujutsu" because it matches "jj".

Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done.

- **Simple and convenient API**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for developers.
- **Cross-browser support**: Tested in various browsers.
- **Multiplexing support**: Allows the creation of several channels for separation of concerns within applications.
- **Room support**: Enables broadcasting to specific groups of users.

If n random actions can make an application fail, it's better to acknowledge it during testing, rather than letting users discover it.

Gremlins.js simulates random user actions: gremlins click anywhere in the window, enter random data in forms, or move the mouse over elements that don't expect it.

Python-mode is a Vim plugin that magically converts Vim into a Python IDE.

Why Python-mode?

1. Be more productive: Pymode saves time by bringing all the tools necessary for professional developers so that you can focus on bigger things. It has been finely tuned based on decades of experience working with Vim and is constantly kept up to date.
2. Get smart assistance: Pymode knows all about your code. We use the best-in-class intellisense code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes; easy project navigation and much more.
3. Use the full power and capabilities of Vim: Unlike traditional IDEs which can only provide a small subset of Vim functionalities, you can do everything and anything that you can in Vim.
4. Modular structure: We attempt to create Python-mode with the same principles of python: i.e. have a modular structure, so that as and when better libraries evolve, we can provide you the best experience, while abstracting the details so that you can get back to what you do best.
5. Written mostly in Python: 96.1% written in Python. Well, we love Python :)

The plugin contains all you need to develop python applications in Vim.

## Introduction

This guide will take you through the steps necessary to continuously deliver your software to end users by leveraging Jenkins and Kubernetes to orchestrate the software delivery pipeline. If you are not familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts, have a look at the relevant documentation.

In order to accomplish this goal you will use the following Jenkins plugins:
- Start Jenkins build executor containers in the Kubernetes cluster when builds are requested, terminate those containers when builds complete, freeing resources up for the rest of the cluster.
- Define our build pipeline declaratively and keep it checked into source code management alongside our application code.
- Allows you to add your Google OAuth credentials to Jenkins.

In order to deploy the application with Kubernetes, you will use the following resources:
- Replicates our application across our Kubernetes nodes and allows us to do a controlled rolling update of our software across the fleet of application instances.
- Load balancing and service discovery for our internal services.
- External load balancing and SSL termination for our external service.
- Secure storage of non-public configuration information, specifically SSL certs in our case.

Boot is a Clojure build framework and ad-hoc Clojure script evaluator. Boot provides a runtime environment that includes all of the tools needed to build Clojure projects from scripts written in Clojure that run in the context of the project.

Build processes for applications always end up being complex things. A simple web application, for instance, may require many integrations—asset pipelines, deployment to different environments, the compilation of multiple artifacts with different compilers, packaging, etc.

The more complex the build process becomes, the more flexible the build tool needs to be. Static build specifications become less and less useful as the project moves toward completion. Being Lispers we know what to do: Lambda is the ultimate declarative.

Instead of building the project based on a global configuration map, Boot provides a runtime environment in which a build script written in Clojure can be evaluated. It is this script—a Turing-complete build specification—which builds the project.

Extracted text: # almond

A replacement loader for AMD modules. It provides a minimal AMD API footprint that includes support. Only useful for built/bundled AMD modules, does not do dynamic loading.

Some developers like to use the AMD API to code modular JavaScript, but after doing an optimized build, they do not want to include a full AMD loader like RequireJS, since they do not need all that functionality. Some use cases, like mobile, are very sensitive to file sizes.

By including almond in the built file, there is no need for RequireJS. almond is around 1 kilobyte when minified with Closure Compiler and gzipped.

Since it can support certain types of loader plugin-optimized resources, it is a great fit for a library that wants to use AMD as part of their project, but get a tiny download in one file after using the optimizer.

If you are building a library, the wrap=true support in the RequireJS optimizer will wrap the optimized file in a closure, so the define/require AMD API does not escape the file. Users of your optimized file will only see the global API you decide to export, not the AMD API. 

So, you get great code cleanliness with AMD and the use of powerful loader plugins in a tiny wrapper that makes it easy for others to use your code even if they do not use AMD.

### Introduction ###

The purpose of Projeny is to allow your Unity3D project to easily scale in size without heavily impacting development time.

Projeny allows you to:

* Share any Unity assets (code, scenes, prefabs, etc.) across multiple different Unity projects without copy and pasting
* Instantly switch between platforms
* Easily upgrade or downgrade installed asset store packages
* Optimize compile time of your project by getting Unity to only recompile the code that changes most often
* Split up your project into discrete packages, so that you can manage the dependencies between each, instead of having one giant Unity project of inter-related files
* Declare dependencies between packages, so that you always get the packages that you need without needing to hunt down missing libraries or broken links
* Generate a more intelligent Visual Studio solution than the Unity default, using package dependencies to create csproj dependencies

NOTE: Projeny requires Unity3D 5.3.1 or higher, since it makes use of the command line switch that is only fixed in 5.3.1.

The reimplementation efforts of OpenLoco are gradual, aiming to ultimately rewrite the entire game in C++. In the earlier years of the project, the in-game UI has been completely reimplemented, and most of the underlying data and object structures have been uncovered. Recent efforts have focused on reimplementing the game logic. Once this has been completed, it is our goal to get a solid multiplayer experience working in OpenLoco. It is also our goal to increase the map and vehicle limits. However, until all logic has been reimplemented, we are bound to the limits imposed by the CSL save format (SV5/SC5).

Extracted text: Certbot is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.

Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free.

Certbot is meant to be run directly on your web server on the command line, not on your personal computer. If you’re using a hosted service and don’t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.

QuickCheck for Swift.

Introduction
============

SwiftCheck is a testing library that automatically generates random data for testing of program properties. A property is a particular facet of an algorithm or data structure that must be invariant under a given set of input data, basically an assertion on steroids. Where before all we could do was define methods prefixed by `assert` and assert, SwiftCheck allows program properties and tests to be treated like data.

To define a program property, the `forAll` quantifier is used with a type signature. SwiftCheck implements the `Arbitrary` protocol for most Swift Standard Library types and implements the `Property` protocol for `Bool` and several other related types. For example, if we wanted to test the property that every Integer is equal to itself, we would express it as such:

For a less contrived example, here is a program property that tests whether Array identity holds under double reversal:

Because SwiftCheck doesn't require tests to return `Void`, just `Bool`, we can produce tests for complex properties with ease.

Properties can even depend on other properties. All you have to figure out is what to test. SwiftCheck will handle the rest.

This also opens up a new way of catching threading and memory issues for free using stress testing.

With Expecto you write tests as values. Tests can be composed, reduced, filtered, repeated and passed as values, because they are values. This gives the programmer a lot of leverage when writing tests. Setup and teardown are just simple functions, no need for attributes.

Expecto comes with batteries included with an integrated test runner, but it's still open for extension due to its compositional model.

Extracted text: # Tiny Renderer or how OpenGL works: software rendering in 500 lines of code

My source code is irrelevant. Read the wiki and implement your own renderer. Only when you suffer through all the tiny details you will learn what is going on.

In this project, I want to show the way OpenGL works by writing its clone (a much simplified one). Surprisingly enough, I often meet people who cannot overcome the initial hurdle of learning OpenGL / DirectX. Thus, I have prepared a short series of lectures, after which my students show quite good renderers.

The task is formulated as follows: using no third-party libraries (especially graphic ones), get something like this picture. 

_Warning: this is a training material that will loosely repeat the structure of the OpenGL library. It will be a software renderer. I do not want to show how to write applications for OpenGL. I want to show how OpenGL works. I am deeply convinced that it is impossible to write efficient applications using 3D libraries without understanding this._

I will try to make the final code about 500 lines. My students need 10 to 20 programming hours to begin making such renderers. At the input, we get a test file with a polygonal wire + pictures with textures. At the output, we’ll get a rendered model. No graphical interface, the program simply generates an image. 

Since the goal is to minimize external dependencies, I give my students just one class that allows working with files. It’s one of the simplest formats that supports images in RGB/RGBA/black and white formats. So, as a starting point, we’ll obtain a simple way to work with pictures. You should note that the only functionality available at the very beginning (in addition to loading and saving images) is the capability to set the color of one pixel.

There are no functions for drawing line segments and triangles. We’ll have to do all of this by hand. I provide my source code that I write in parallel with students. But I would not recommend using it, as this doesn’t make sense. The entire code is available on GitHub, and you will find the source code I give to my students.

neural-storyteller is a recurrent neural network that generates little stories about images. This repository contains code for generating stories with your own images, as well as instructions for training new models. 

The style-shifting operation is what allows our model to transfer standard image captions to the style of stories from novels. The only source of supervision in our models is from captions. That is, we did not collect any new training data to directly predict stories given images. 

We first train a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder on romance novels. Each passage from a novel is mapped to a skip-thought vector. The RNN then conditions on the skip-thought vector and aims to generate the passage that it has encoded. Parallel to this, we train a visual-semantic embedding between COCO images and captions. In this model, captions and images are mapped into a common vector space. 

Given these models, we need a way to bridge the gap between retrieved image captions and passages in novels. Skip-thought vectors have some intriguing properties that allow us to construct a function that maps a collection of image caption vectors to a book passage vector. 

The project aims to generate stories that reflect the style of romance novels based on the content of images.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps.

Tools and standards abound for creating and enriching metadata, but measuring, monitoring, and managing metadata for the long haul can be a daunting task. What tools are out there to assess the shape of our metadata? How can visualizations show us the gaps or flaws in our description? What can web traffic analytics tell us about the value of our metadata? What is quality, really? We certainly don’t have all the answers, but together we can workshop the questions. Specific topics will be driven by the interest of attendees. The organizers will bring examples of their own work at NYPL in visualization, data analysis with Python, and Google analytics assessment and invite participants to bring their own tools and strategies to share in group discussion, short demos, and hands-on breakout sessions. Takeaways will include: exposure to approaches and tools in use in the field and an expanded network of commiserators to help you through your next metadata audit.

Extracted text: # How To Train an Object Detection Classifier for Multiple Objects Using TensorFlow (GPU) on Windows 10

## Brief Summary
This repository is a tutorial for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Windows 10, 8, or 7. It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.5, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow. The repository provides all the files needed to train a "Pinochle Deck" playing card detector that can accurately detect nines, tens, jacks, queens, kings, and aces. The tutorial describes how to replace these files with your own files to train a detection classifier for whatever your heart desires. It also has Python scripts to test your classifier out on an image, video, or webcam feed.

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to train your own convolutional neural network object detection classifier for multiple objects, starting from scratch. At the end of this tutorial, you will have a program that can identify and draw boxes around specific objects in pictures, videos, or in a webcam feed. The tutorial is written for Windows 10, and it will also work for Windows 7 and 8. TensorFlow-GPU allows your PC to use the video card to provide extra processing power while training, significantly reducing training time compared to the CPU-only version.

Extracted text: # Awesome Elixir Books

Adoption is more than programming. Elixir is an exciting new language, but to successfully get your application from start to finish, you’re going to need to know more than just the language. You need the case studies and strategies in this book. Learn the best practices for the whole life of your application, from design and team-building, to managing stakeholders, to deployment and monitoring. Go beyond the syntax and the tools to learn the techniques you need to develop your Elixir application from concept to production.

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

Elixir in Action teaches you how to solve practical problems of scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability using Elixir. You'll start with the language, learning basic constructs and building blocks. Then, you'll learn to think about problems using Elixir's functional programming mindset. With that solid foundation, you'll confidently explore Elixir's seamless integration with BEAM and Erlang's powerful OTP framework of battle-tested abstractions you can use immediately. Finally, the book provides guidance on how to distribute a system over multiple machines and control it in production.

Elixir is an excellent language if you want to learn about functional programming, and with this hands-on introduction, you’ll discover just how powerful and fun Elixir can be. This language combines the robust functional programming of Erlang with a syntax similar to Ruby, and includes powerful features for metaprogramming.

Elixir’s straightforward syntax and this guided tour give you a clean, simple path to learn modern functional programming techniques. No previous functional programming experience required! This book walks you through the right concepts at the right pace, as you explore immutable values and explicit data transformation, functions, modules, recursive functions, pattern matching, high-order functions, polymorphism, and failure handling, all while avoiding side effects.

Active Merchant is an extraction from the ecommerce system. Shopify's requirements for a simple and unified API to access dozens of different payment gateways with very different internal APIs was the chief principle in designing the library.

It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly as a Rails plugin, but it also works excellently as a stand-alone Ruby library.

Active Merchant has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used in most modern Ruby applications which deal with financial transactions. It is maintained by the teams, with much help from an ever-growing set of contributors.

This tutorial is intended to show what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is, why we need it, and how it can help you manage your infrastructure more efficiently.

It is practice-based, meaning I don't give much theory on what Infrastructure as Code is in the beginning of the tutorial, but instead let you feel it through the practice first. At the end of the tutorial, I summarize some of the key points about Infrastructure as Code based on what you learn through the labs.

This tutorial is not meant to give a complete guide on how to use a specific tool like Ansible or Terraform; instead, it focuses on how these tools work in general and what problems they solve. 

The target audience for this tutorial is anyone who loves or/and works in IT. 

By the end of this tutorial, you'll make your own repository.

Yet another Markdown parser, this time for JavaScript. There are a few options that precede this project, but they all treat Markdown to HTML conversion as a single step process. You pass Markdown in and get HTML out, end of story. We had some pretty particular views on how the process should actually look, which include:

  * Producing well-formed HTML. This means that nesting is important, as is the ability to output as both HTML and XHTML.
  * Having an intermediate representation to allow processing of parsed data (we in fact have two: a markdown tree and an HTML tree).
  * Being easily extensible to add new dialects without having to rewrite the entire parsing mechanics.
  * Having a good test suite. The only test suites we could find tested massive blocks of input, and passing depended on outputting the HTML with exactly the same whitespace as the original implementation.

_CSS the way it was imagined._

Myth is a preprocessor that lets you write pure CSS without having to worry about slow browser support, or even slow spec approval. It's like a CSS polyfill.

Myth lets you write pure CSS while still giving you the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass. You can still use variables and math functions, just like you do in preprocessors. It's like a polyfill for future versions of the spec.

Some of the features in CSS require runtime calculations, which neither Myth nor preprocessors handle, but what Myth does is let you write your code today in the future syntax, so that your code is future-proof. When browsers finally support these features you won't need to rewrite anything, just start using the cascade!

Taking plain CSS as an input also means you can use Myth to re-process anyone else's CSS (or another preprocessor's output), adding the browser support you need, without having to re-write the code in a completely different syntax.

Myth is built with Rework so it's incredibly fast, and has a nice Javascript API in addition to the CLI.

GCToolkit is a set of libraries for analyzing HotSpot Java garbage collection (GC) log files. The toolkit parses GC log files into discrete events and provides an API for aggregating data from those events. This allows the user to create arbitrary and complex analyses of the state of managed memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) represented by the garbage collection log.

Managed memory in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is composed of 3 main pieces:

1. Memory buffers known as Java heap
2. Allocators which perform the work of getting data into Java heap
3. Garbage Collection (GC)

While GC is responsible for recovering memory in Java heap that is no longer in use, the term is often used as a euphemism for memory management. The phrasing of Tuning GC or tuning the collector are often used with the understanding that it refers to tuning the JVM’s memory management subsystem. The best source of telemetry data for tuning GC comes from GC Logs and GCToolKit has been helpful in making this task easier by providing parsers, models and an API to build analytics with.

Extracted text: FreeFlow is a layout engine for Android that decouples layouts from the View containers that manage scrolling and view recycling. FreeFlow makes it really easy to create custom layouts and beautiful transition animations as layouts are changed.

FreeFlow is a composition-based approach to Android Layouts. As opposed to default Android Layouts, FreeFlow Layouts are swappable at runtime, allowing views to transition to their new states smoothly. The fundamental difference here is that FreeFlow prefers adaptability in the system.

FreeFlow may be considered in "alpha". You can help in many ways, by reviewing and making suggestions on APIs, finding bugs, and submitting patches via pull requests.

FreeFlow is inspired by UI frameworks like UICollectionViews on iOS and the Spark Architecture in Flex.

- Description: Application Kernel for Containers

Extracted text: ## What is gVisor?

gVisor is an application kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system surface. It includes a runtime that provides an isolation boundary between the application and the host kernel. The runtime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, making it simple to run sandboxed containers.

## Why does gVisor exist?

Containers are not a sandbox. While containers have revolutionized how we develop, package, and deploy applications, using them to run untrusted or potentially malicious code without additional isolation is not a good idea. gVisor is an application kernel for containers. It limits the host kernel surface accessible to the application while still giving the application access to all the features it expects. Unlike most kernels, gVisor does not assume or require a fixed set of physical resources; instead, it leverages existing host kernel functionality and runs as a normal process. In other words, gVisor implements Linux by way of Linux.

## Introduction

The open Home Automation Bus (openHAB) project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around home automation. It is a pure Java solution, fully based on OSGi.

It is designed to be vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices, and interface protocols by dedicated bindings. These bindings send and receive commands and status updates on the openHAB event bus. This concept allows designing user interfaces with a unique look&feel, but with the possibility to operate devices based on a big number of different technologies. Besides the user interfaces, it also brings the power of automation logic across different system boundaries.

Database development is interesting and challenging. You can always find interesting things to learn and challenging problems to solve. You need to know a lot of things and get them right to build a reliable and high-performance database. And it takes time, a lot of time, to think and practice. I have been working on database development for ten years. However, as the proverb goes, the more I know, the more I realize I don’t know. So, I collect these awesome materials here to review them from time to time. I think it will be helpful to those who share the same interests as me.

## Introduction

Readings in Database Systems (commonly known as the "Red Book") has offered readers an opinionated take on both classic and cutting-edge research in the field of data management since 1988.

In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.

Internally at Microsoft, BuildXL runs 150,000+ builds per day on codebases up to a half-terabyte in size with a half-million process executions per build. It leverages distribution to thousands of data center machines and petabytes of source code, package, and build output caching. Thousands of developers use BuildXL on their desktops for faster builds.

BuildXL accelerates multiple build languages, including:
- MSBuild (experimental: using new features under development in MSBuild 16 which will ship in future versions of Visual Studio 2019 and the .NET Core SDK)
- CMake / Ninja (beta)
- Its own internal scripting language, DScript, an experimental TypeScript based format used as an intermediate language by a small number of teams inside Microsoft

BuildXL has a command-line interface. There are currently no plans to integrate it into Visual Studio. The project is open source in the spirit of transparency of our engineering system. You may find our technology useful if you face similar issues of scale. Note that BuildXL is not intended as a replacement for MSBuild or to indicate any future direction of build languages from Microsoft.

- Modular component-based design: Feature implementations, above all, strive to be as generally applicable and configurable as possible, potentially at some cost of faithfully resembling details of the introducing paper.
- Separation of RL algorithm and application: Algorithms are agnostic to the type and structure of inputs (states/observations) and outputs (actions/decisions), as well as the interaction with the application environment.
- Full-on TensorFlow models: The entire reinforcement learning logic, including control flow, is implemented in TensorFlow, to enable portable computation graphs independent of application programming language, and to facilitate the deployment of models.

Extracted text: # RL-movie-recommender

The purpose of our research is to study reinforcement learning approaches to building a movie recommender system. We formulate the problem of interactive recommendation as a contextual multi-armed bandit, learning user preferences, recommending new movies, and receiving their ratings. We show that using reinforcement learning solves the problem of exploitation-exploration trade-off and the cold-start problem. We integrate the novelty of movies into the model. We explore a content-based approach as well as a collaborative filtering approach, and both yield viable recommendation results.

Extracted text: PixiJS — The HTML5 Creation Engine

This project aims to provide a fast, lightweight 2D library that works across all devices. The PixiJS renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. Also, it's fast. Really fast.

PixiJS is a rendering library that will allow you to create rich, interactive graphics and cross-platform applications and games without having to dive into the WebGL API or deal with browser and device compatibility. PixiJS has full support and seamlessly falls back to HTML5 if needed. As a framework, PixiJS is a fantastic tool for authoring interactive content, especially with the move away from Adobe Flash in recent years. Use it for your graphics-rich, interactive websites, applications, and HTML5 games. Out-of-the-box, cross-platform compatibility and graceful degradation mean you have less work to do and more fun doing it! If you want to create polished and refined experiences relatively quickly without delving into dense, low-level code, all while avoiding the headaches of browser inconsistencies, then sprinkle your next project with some PixiJS magic!

Extracted text: Cabot is a free, open-source, self-hosted infrastructure monitoring platform that provides some of the best features of Nagios and others without their cost and complexity. It offers a web interface to monitor services (e.g., "Stage Redis server", "Production ElasticSearch cluster") and send alerts via telephone, SMS, or email to your on-duty team if those services start misbehaving or go down, all without writing a line of code. You can alert based on metrics, status codes, response content of web endpoints, and build statuses. 

Cabot was built as a Christmas project because the creators couldn't wrap their heads around Nagios, and nothing else seemed to fit their use case. It is written in Python and utilizes various technologies under the hood.

- Description: Dates and times made easy in iOS

Extracted text: ## DateTools

DateTools was written to streamline date and time handling in iOS. Classes and concepts from other languages served as an inspiration for DateTools, especially the structure and for .NET. Through these classes and others, DateTools removes the boilerplate required to access date components, handles more nuanced date comparisons, and serves as the foundation for entirely new concepts like Time Periods and their collections.

One of the missions of DateTools was to make Date feel more complete. There are many other languages that allow direct access to information about dates from their date classes, but Date (sadly) does not. It safely works only in the Unix time offsets through the timeIntervalSince... methods for building dates and remains calendar agnostic. But that's not always what we want to do. Sometimes, we want to work with dates based on their date components (like year, month, day, etc) at a more abstract level. This is where DateTools comes in.

derives from the Arabic word taqaddum (تقدّم) which can mean "progress," and is an abbreviation for "I love you so much" in Spanish (te quiero demasiado).

Instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter - just wrap any iterable with tqdm, and you're done!

tqdm can be also used as a convenient shortcut for command-line operations.

Overhead is low -- about 60ns per iteration (80ns with manual updates), and is unit tested against performance regression. In addition to its low overhead, tqdm uses smart algorithms to predict the remaining time and to skip unnecessary iteration displays, which allows for a negligible overhead in most cases.

tqdm works on any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris/SunOS), in any console or in a GUI, and is also friendly with IPython/Jupyter notebooks.

tqdm does not require any dependencies (not even a terminal), just Python and an environment supporting ANSI and control characters.

- Description: A Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm

Extracted text: # virtual-dom

A JavaScript library designed for efficient re-rendering of the DOM. 

Manual DOM manipulation is messy and keeping track of the previous DOM state is hard. A solution to this problem is to write your code as if you were recreating the entire DOM whenever state changes. However, recreating the entire DOM every time your application state changes would be slow and could cause input fields to lose focus.

This library is a collection of modules that provide a declarative way of representing the DOM for your app. Instead of updating the DOM when your application state changes, you create a virtual tree that resembles the desired DOM state. The library then efficiently updates the DOM to match this state without recreating all of the DOM nodes.

It allows you to update a view whenever state changes by creating a full representation of the view and then patching the DOM efficiently to match your description, promoting clean and maintainable rendering logic for web applications.

Extracted text: # Bundler: a gem to bundle gems

Bundler makes sure Ruby applications run the same code on every machine. It does this by managing the gems that the application depends on. Given a list of gems, it can automatically download and install those gems, as well as any other gems needed by the gems that are listed. Before installing gems, it checks the versions of every gem to make sure that they are compatible, and can all be loaded at the same time. After the gems have been installed, Bundler can help you update some or all of them when new versions become available. Finally, it records the exact versions that have been installed, so that others can install the exact same gems.

Dopamine is a research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms. It aims to fill the need for a small, easily grokked codebase in which users can freely experiment with wild ideas (speculative research).

Our design principles are:

* Easy experimentation: Make it easy for new users to run benchmark experiments.
* Flexible development: Make it easy for new users to try out research ideas.
* Compact and reliable: Provide implementations for a few, battle-tested algorithms.
* Reproducible: Facilitate reproducibility in results.

Dopamine supports the following agents, implemented with jax:

* DQN
* C51
* Rainbow
* IQN
* SAC

Many of these agents also have a tensorflow (legacy) implementation, though newly added agents are likely to be jax-only.

Extracted text: # zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.

If you have a trace ID in a log file, you can jump directly to it. Otherwise, you can query based on attributes such as service, operation name, tags, and duration. Some interesting data will be summarized for you, such as the percentage of time spent in a service and whether or not operations failed.

The Zipkin UI also presents a dependency diagram showing how many traced requests went through each application. This can be helpful for identifying aggregate behavior, including error paths or calls to deprecated services.

Applications need to be instrumented to report trace data to Zipkin, usually via HTTP or Kafka, though many other options exist. The data served to the UI is stored in-memory or persistently with a supported backend such as Apache Cassandra or Elasticsearch.

Extracted text: # Selfie

Selfie is a project at the Department of Computer Sciences of the University of Salzburg in Austria.

The Selfie Project provides an educational platform for teaching undergraduate and graduate students the design and implementation of programming languages and runtime systems. The focus is on the construction of compilers, libraries, operating systems, and virtual machine monitors. The common theme is to identify and resolve self-reference in systems code, which is seen as the key challenge when teaching systems engineering, hence the name.

Selfie is a self-contained 64-bit, 12KLOC C implementation of:

1. a self-compiling compiler called starc that compiles a tiny but still fast language called C Star to a tiny and easy-to-teach subset of RISC-V,
2. a self-executing emulator called mipster that executes RISC-U code including itself when compiled with starc,
3. a self-hosting hypervisor called hypster that provides RISC-U virtual machines that can host all of selfie, that is, starc, mipster, and hypster itself, and
4. a tiny C* library called libcstar utilized by selfie.

Selfie is implemented in a single file and kept minimal for simplicity. There is also a simple in-memory linker, a RISC-U disassembler, a garbage collector, L1 instruction and data caches, a profiler, and a debugger with replay as well as minimal operating system support in the form of RISC-V system calls built into the emulator and hypervisor. The garbage collector is conservative and even self-collecting. It may operate as a library in the same address space as the mutator and/or as part of the emulator in the address space of the kernel.

Selfie generates ELF binaries that run on real hardware as well as on simulators and are compatible with the official RISC-V toolchain. Selfie is designed as a 64-bit system and requires a 64-bit system to run (LP64 data model). However, selfie also compiles on systems that support compiling and executing 32-bit binaries (ILP32 data model). In that case, selfie becomes a 32-bit system that generates and executes 32-bit binaries out-of-the-box. This is possible because the implementation of selfie carefully avoids 32-bit overflows throughout the system.

Extracted text: # Introduction

Fleet is GitOps at scale. Fleet is designed to manage multiple clusters. It's also lightweight enough that it works great for a single cluster too, but it really shines when you get to a large scale. By large scale, we mean either a lot of clusters, a lot of deployments, or a lot of teams in a single organization.

Fleet can manage deployments from git of raw Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, or Kustomize or any combination of the three. Regardless of the source, all resources are dynamically turned into Helm charts, and Helm is used as the engine to deploy everything in the cluster. This gives a high degree of control, consistency, and auditability. Fleet focuses not only on the ability to scale but also on providing a high degree of control and visibility to exactly what is installed on the cluster.

Extracted text: # Stargate

An open source data API gateway.

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a Cassandra database. For developers, it makes it easy to use Cassandra for any application workload by adding plugin support for new APIs, data types, and access methods - even secondary database models. Its built with extensibility as a first-class citizen to enable rapid innovation. For operators, Stargate introduces microservice architecture, allowing independent deployment and scale of storage nodes, API Service nodes, and coordinator nodes in Cassandra clusters.

We created Stargate because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With "read the manual" fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we started a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads?

This project enables customization of all aspects of data access and has modules for authentication, APIs, request handling / routing, and persistence backends. The current form is specific to Apache Cassandra (C*) compatible backends.

As shown in the figure below, Stargate is often deployed behind a load balancer or proxy and exposes multiple endpoints to client applications, including HTTP APIs, gRPC, and the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). Stargate sits in front of a Cassandra cluster which is used as the storage backend.

Extracted text: Humbug is a Mutation Testing framework for PHP. It is currently in development and so, while it does actually work quite well, it will have rough edges that a team of minions are working hard to hammer out. If it falls out of the gate, you have been warned ;).

Mutation Testing is, in a nutshell, giving your unit tests a run for their money. It involves injecting small defects into source code and then checking if the unit tests noticed. If they do, then your unit tests have "killed" the mutation. If not, the mutation has escaped detection. As unit tests are intended to prevent regressions, having a real regression pass unnoticed would be a bad thing!

Whereas Code Coverage can tell you what code your tests are executing, Mutation Testing is intended to help you judge how well your unit tests actually perform and where they could be improved.

SSToolkit was a grab bag of iOS goodies. It was a giant collection of classes that I started in 2008. This was getting out of hand. That version is completely deprecated.

Now SSToolkit is made up of several libraries you can use independently. SSToolkit is now just a header file and a with dependencies for each library. I don't recommend using the pod.

Here’s what’s included:

* Clone of Safari's address bar from iOS 6.
* Simple badge view.
* Easy gradients in UIKit.
* Kinda okay HUD.
* UILabel with vertical alignment and text insets.
* Simple loading view.
* Determinate, circular progress view.
* Simple utility for only executing code every so often.
* Handy UITextField additions like insetting text.
* Add a placeholder to UITextView.
* Push UIWebView to its limits.
* A collection of useful Foundation and UIKit categories.

Several of these libraries have had big improvements since their abstraction from SSToolkit.

A Python package for interactive geospatial analysis and visualization with Google Earth Engine.

Introduction

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a vast archive of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Over the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. Compared with the comprehensive JavaScript API and interactive IDE of GEE, the GEE Python API has relatively little documentation and limited functionality for visualizing results interactively. The geemap package enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment. 

The **geemap** package can greatly reduce the time needed to convert existing GEE JavaScripts to Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

menu-aim is a jQuery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate between a user trying to hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into a submenu's contents.

This problem is normally solved using timeouts and delays. menu-aim tries to solve this by detecting the direction of the user's mouse movement.

KIF builds and performs the tests using a standard testing target. Testing is conducted synchronously in the main thread (running the run loop to force the passage of time) allowing for more complex logic and composition. This also allows KIF to take advantage of the Xcode Test Navigator, command line build tools, and Bot test reports.

KIF uses undocumented Apple APIs. This is true of most iOS testing frameworks, and is safe for testing purposes, but it's important that KIF does not make it into production code, as it will get your app submission denied by Apple.

WunderGraph is a Backend for Frontend (BFF) Framework designed to optimize Developer Workflows through API Composition.

At its core, WunderGraph combines two patterns with the concept of a package manager, making API composition as simple as npm install. Our mantra is: Compose, don.

API Composition is a new pattern that allows you to interact with a heterogeneous set of APIs as if they were a single unified API. This not just eliminates a lot of glue code, but also allows you to reason about the API Dependencies of an application. WunderGraph can easily answer what APIs and Services your application depends on, and provides analytics and observability into what APIs and Endpoints are used by your application and the quality of service your API dependencies provide.

This repository contains Python code for a selection of tables, figures, and LAB sections from the first edition of the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2013).

This great book gives a thorough introduction to the field of Statistical/Machine Learning. The book contains sections with applications in R based on public datasets available for download or which are part of the R-package ISLR. Furthermore, there is a Stanford University online course based on this book taught by the authors.

Since Python is my language of choice for data analysis, I decided to try and do some of the calculations and plots in Jupyter Notebooks using various libraries. It was a good way to learn more about Machine Learning in Python by creating these notebooks. I created some of the figures/tables of the chapters and worked through some LAB sections. Note that this repository is not a standalone tutorial and that you probably should have a copy of the book to follow along. Suggestions for improvement and help with unsolved issues are welcome!

Mastodon is a social networking software platform. It allows someone to run their own social media site (and let other people use it too, if they want), and each Mastodon site is capable of talking to all of the other Mastodon social media sites. It's like a cross between Twitter and email, but it's not exactly like either of those.

Plaid was written with one big goal: showcase material design in Android in a real application. While Plaid successfully achieved its goal, from an architecture point of view, it lacks all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app: with UI logic in Android classes, no tests and only one module. Plaid represents a great real world app example: it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities, it has technical debt, it has features that have to be dealt with as APIs are being removed. All of these problems are encountered by many projects in the Android community and therefore, make Plaid a suitable showcase for all the advantages that architecture components bring. 

Plaid is a showcase of design news and inspiration. It pulls in news & inspiration from various sources and demonstrates the use of material design to create tactile, bold, understandable UIs.

#### Data Science Immersive Capstone project

#### Project Motivation
Near the beginning of the galvanize DSI program I started a blog for myself. I wanted a place to help promote myself as I try to transition careers. A place to contribute my data science thoughts, and trip reports. Plus it also just seemed like it could be fun. My fledging blog still needs lots of work, but I do have a decent start on it.

#### Is it possible to identify elements that contribute to a successful blog?
While in the DSI program I was wondering if I could use some of my new data science skills to identify elements of a blog that can lead to its success. Of course I would never be able to identify everything that makes a blog do well. It would be hard to capture the visual appeal of a blog, and it would be almost impossible to capture aspects like self-promotion. That being said I thought it was possible to capture some aspects.

##### Project Overview and Workflow
To do this analysis a single topic of blogs was chosen to limit the effect of better topics doing significantly differently. The project involved gathering as many blogs as I felt like, for this I gathered 2500 blogs. Then much cleaning and some topic filtering took place. The problem is split into two sub-problems: one to deal with identifying elements of successful posts, and one to identify elements of successful blogs.

As pentesters, we've been accustomed to the /pentest/ directories or our own toolsets that we want to keep up-to-date all of the time. We have those "go to" tools that we use on a regular basis, and using the latest and greatest is important.

PTF attempts to install all of your penetration testing tools (latest and greatest), compile them, build them, and make it so that you can install/update your distribution on any machine. Everything is organized in a fashion that is cohesive to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and eliminates a lot of things that are hardly used. PTF simplifies installation and packaging and creates an entire pentest framework for you. Since this is a framework, you can configure and add as you see fit. We commonly see internally developed repos that you can use as well as part of this framework. It's all up to you.

The ultimate goal is for community support on this project. We want new tools added to the GitHub repository. Submit your modules. It's super simple to configure and add them and only takes a few minutes.

The Derby MVC framework makes it easy to write realtime, collaborative applications that run in both Node.js and browsers.

Derby includes a powerful data synchronization engine called Racer that automatically syncs data among browsers, servers, and a database. Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications.

Derby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline.

Heap Explorer is a Memory Profiler, Debugger, and Analyzer for Unity. This repository hosts Heap Explorer for Unity 2019.3 and newer versions. For older versions, please visit the obsolete repository on Bitbucket instead.

I have spent a significant amount of time in the past identifying and fixing memory leaks, as well as searching for memory optimization opportunities in Unity applications. During this time, I often used Unity's Memory Profiler. While it's a useful tool, I was never entirely satisfied with it.

This led me to develop my own memory profiler, where I had the opportunity to address all the things I disliked about Unity's Memory Profiler and make them better. Since then, I have provided occasional updates because several people still prefer Heap Explorer over Unity's Memory Profiler due to its easier-to-understand UI/UX.

I have also updated Heap Explorer to work with Unity 2019.3 and converted it into a Package, which means you should be able to use Heap Explorer for the entire 2019 LTS cycle, which ends in 2022.

A headless starter for WordPress powered by Next.js

## Introduction

Querying a REST-API or GraphQL endpoint and looping over blog posts is where many tutorials about "headless WordPress" stop. You'd be hard pressed to find a deep-dive into advanced functionality because: headless WordPress is hard.

At WebDevStudios we believe that WordPress is so much more than a blog-- and our clients require support for things like: SEO, menus, forms, previews, search, comments, authentication, custom post types, custom fields, etc...

This tool is a distributed code review system for git repos.

By "distributed", we mean that code reviews are stored inside of the repository as git objects. Every developer on your team has their own copy of the review history that they can push or pull. When pulling, updates from the remote repo are automatically merged by the tool.

This design removes the need for any sort of server-side setup. As a result, this tool can work with any git hosting provider, and the only setup required is installing the client on your workstation.

Extracted text: # Introduction

Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.

* FASTER Log is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums.

* FASTER KV is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a fast non-blocking checkpointing technique that lets applications trade-off performance for commit latency.

Both FASTER KV and FASTER Log offer orders-of-magnitude higher performance than comparable solutions, on standard workloads.

We call the Ruby class the "view" and the HTML template the "template."

All your logic, decisions, and code is contained in your view. All your markup is contained in your template. The template does nothing but reference methods in your view.

This strict separation makes it easier to write clean templates, easier to test your views, and more fun to work on your apps front end.

Extracted text: This repository is an overview of what you need to learn penetration testing and a collection of hacking tools, resources, and references to practice ethical hacking. Most of the tools are UNIX compatible, free, and open source.

## Introduction

### What is penetration testing?
Penetration testing is a type of security testing that is used to test the security of an application. It is conducted to find a security risk which might be present in a system. If a system is not secure, then an attacker may be able to disrupt or take unauthorized control of that system. A security risk is normally an accidental error that occurs while developing and implementing software, such as configuration errors, design errors, and software bugs.

### Want to become a penetration tester?
Knowing about risks on the internet and how they can be prevented is very useful, especially as a developer. Web hacking and penetration testing is the v2.0 of self-defense! A real penetration tester must be able to proceed rigorously and detect the weaknesses of an application. They must be able to identify the technology behind and test every single door that might be open to hackers.

This repository aims first to establish a reflection method on penetration testing and explain how to proceed to secure an application. Secondly, it regroups all kinds of tools or resources pen testers need. Be sure to know the basics of programming languages and internet security before learning pen testing. It is also important to inform yourself about the law and what you are allowed to do or not, as computer laws vary by country. Always check if what you're doing is legal, as information gathering can also be illegal!

Extracted text: # future: Unified Parallel and Distributed Processing in R for Everyone

## Introduction

The purpose of the future package is to provide a very simple and uniform way of evaluating R expressions asynchronously using various resources available to the user.

In programming, a future is an abstraction for a value that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved. As soon as it is resolved, the value is available instantaneously. If the value is queried while the future is still unresolved, the current process is blocked until the future is resolved. It is possible to check whether a future is resolved or not without blocking. Exactly how and when futures are resolved depends on what strategy is used to evaluate them. For instance, a future can be resolved using a sequential strategy, which means it is resolved in the current R session. Other strategies may be to resolve futures asynchronously, for instance, by evaluating expressions in parallel on the current machine or concurrently on a compute cluster.

So why are futures useful? Because we can choose to evaluate the future expression in a separate R process asynchronously by simply switching settings. With asynchronous futures, the current/main R process does not block, which means it is available for further processing while the futures are being resolved in separate processes running in the background. In other words, futures provide a simple but yet powerful construct for parallel and/or distributed processing in R.

Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified.

As a CS major student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program. There are discussion forums on most MOOC platforms, however, even a question with detailed description may need some time to be answered. Here I released these solutions, which are only for your reference purpose. It may help you to save some time. And I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure. This course is almost the simplest deep learning course I have ever taken, but the simplicity is based on the fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure given by deeplearning.ai team.

Spleeter is a source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses TensorFlow. It makes it easy to train source separation models (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources) and provides already trained state-of-the-art models for performing various flavors of separation:

* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation
* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation
* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation

2 stems and 4 stems models have been trained on the dataset. Spleeter is also very fast, as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.

We designed Spleeter so you can use it straight from the command line as well as directly in your own development pipeline as a library. It can be installed with pip or be used with Docker.

HRE is a real-time, physically based, clustered renderer built with OpenGL, based on techniques described in a paper by Ola Olsson, Markus Billeter, and Ulf Assarsson.

This algorithm was selected for its two major benefits over traditional deferred/tiled solutions: it allows for more freedom to choose forward or deferred shading paths as desired and is a better long-term fit for modern GPU performance trends. 

Unfortunately, this project is no longer maintained as the author was hired as a Graphics Programmer at Rockstar Games and does not have the time to work on a side project of this size anymore.

Extracted text: # PHPMailer – A full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is `mail()`. However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms; however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server. PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and safer to use SMTP to localhost.

Please don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that you should look at before rolling your own.

# Short-Term Plasticity in a Liquid State Machine Biomimetic Robot Arm Controller

## Abstract:
Biological neural networks are able to control limbs in different scenarios, with high precision and robustness. As neural networks in living beings communicate through spikes, modern neuromorphic systems try to mimic them making use of spike-based neuron models. Liquid State Machines (LSM), a special type of Reservoir Computing system made of spiking units, when it was first introduced, had plasticity on an external layer and also through Short-Term Plasticity (STP) within the reservoir itself. However, most neuromorphic hardware currently available does not implement both Short-Term Depression and Facilitation and some of them don't support STP at all. In this work we test the impact of STP in an experimental way using a 2 degrees of freedom simulated robotic arm controlled by an LSM. Four trajectories are learned and their reproduction analysed with Dynamic Time Warping accumulated cost as the benchmark. The results from two different set-ups showed the use of STP in the reservoir was not computationally cost-effective for this particular robotic task.

With just one hook, you can significantly simplify the data fetching logic in your project. And it also covered in all aspects of speed, correctness, and stability to help you build better experiences:

- Fast, lightweight and reusable data fetching
- Transport and protocol agnostic
- Built-in cache and request deduplication
- Real-time experience
- Revalidation on focus
- Revalidation on network recovery
- Polling
- Pagination and scroll position recovery
- SSR and SSG
- Local mutation (Optimistic UI)
- Built-in smart error retry
- TypeScript
- React Suspense
- React Native

With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically. Thus, the UI will be always fast and reactive.

With ice_cube, you can specify (in increasing order of precedence):

* Recurrence Rules - Rules on how to include recurring times in a schedule
* Recurrence Times - To specifically include in a schedule
* Exception Times - To specifically exclude from a schedule

The reason that schedules have durations and not individual rules, is to maintain compatibility with the ical RFC.

Intel ME is a co-processor integrated in all post-2006 Intel boards, which is the base hardware for many Intel features like Intel AMT, Intel Boot Guard, Intel PAVP and many others. To provide such features, it requires full access to the system, including memory (through DMA) and network access (transparent to the user).

Unlike many other firmware components, the Intel ME firmware can't be neither disabled nor reimplemented, as it is tightly integrated in the boot process and it is signed.

This poses an issue both to the free firmware implementations, which are forced to rely on a proprietary, obscure and always-on blob, and to the privacy-aware users, who are reasonably worried about such firmware, running on the lowest privilege ring on x86.

## Capital Bikeshare: Predictions of Near-Term Supply and Demand

This project is a demand and outage predictor for Capital Bikeshare. I take dock status and trip history, weather and calendar data, then fit a random forest regression model to estimate the customer demand for bikes and docks at each bikeshare station as a function of ten predictors:
- Time of Day
- Day of Week
- Day of Year
- Holiday (Y/N)
- Year
- Air Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation within the past hour
- Snow depth

I demonstrate this model with a customer-facing app that predicts CaBi demand and station outages in the immediate future. This app scrapes real-time dock status and weather data to form a feature vector, estimates customer demand for bikes and docks using the random forest, then computes outage probabilities with a Poisson model. Predictions are visualized on a map using leaflet.js. Result is published to a web app using Flask, hosted on heroku.

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning system for semantic image segmentation built on top of deep convolutional neural networks. It combines (1) atrous convolution to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed, (2) atrous spatial pyramid pooling to robustly segment objects at multiple scales, and (3) densely connected conditional random fields (CRF) as post processing. This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest research.

What happened to localtunnel? After pioneering instant public tunnels to localhost, many people copied the project and started businesses around the idea. Localtunnel fell into obscurity. Today, Alan Shreve's rightly dominates mindshare on the idea.

This repo now contains localtunnel v3, a very minimal implementation (under 200 lines) written in Go using my new project. Duplex lets you make stuff like localtunnel very easily. Although usable, there is no public server and the scope of the project is pretty fixed where it is.

This repo also continues to exist to archive the history of the project. You'll find several interesting branches here:

* (2011-2013) - Attempt to revitalize the project and service, v2 was written end-to-end in Python gevent and resolved many issues and requests from v1.
* (mid 2010) - The original implementation that became popular. It worked quite well, but was a dirty hack. It wrapped OpenSSH, with a client in Ruby and a control server in Python Twisted.
* (early 2010) - When I first had the idea, I tried using Python Twisted to implement the whole system. I didn't have the experience to get stream multiplexing to work, so this version is pretty broken.

- Description: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Extracted text: # Faiss

Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta's group.

Faiss contains several methods for similarity search. It assumes that the instances are represented as vectors and are identified by an integer, and that the vectors can be compared with L2 (Euclidean) distances or dot products. Vectors that are similar to a query vector are those that have the lowest L2 distance or the highest dot product with the query vector. It also supports cosine similarity, since this is a dot product on normalized vectors.

Some of the methods, like those based on binary vectors and compact quantization codes, solely use a compressed representation of the vectors and do not require to keep the original vectors. This generally comes at the cost of a less precise search but these methods can scale to billions of vectors in main memory on a single server. Other methods, like HNSW and NSG add an indexing structure on top of the raw vectors to make searching more efficient.

The GPU implementation can accept input from either CPU or GPU memory. On a server with GPUs, the GPU indexes can be used a drop-in replacement for the CPU indexes and copies to/from GPU memory are handled automatically. Results will be faster however if both input and output remain resident on the GPU. Both single and multi-GPU usage is supported.

Extracted text: is a Node server that acts as a local npm registry. It serves modules, caches them, and updates them whenever they change. Basically, it's a local mirror, but without having to replicate the entire npm registry.

This allows your commands to (mostly) work offline. Also, they get faster and faster over time, as commonly-installed modules are aggressively cached.

acts as a proxy between you and the main npm registry. You run commands like normal, but under the hood, all requests are sent through the local server.

When you first install a module, it will be fetched from the main npm registry. After that, the module and all its dependencies (at that version) are stored in a local database, so you can expect subsequent installs to be much faster.

The server will also listen for changes from the remote registry, so you can expect updates to a module's metadata to be replicated within seconds of being published. This means you won't get stuck with old versions.

If you're organizing a conference/meetup/whatever, you can also share this local server with multiple people. So if your teammates are constantly installing the same modules over and over again, this can save a lot of time in the long run.

is also a good way to make npm work offline. Assuming new versions of a package haven't been published since you last installed, subsequent installs will all serve from the cache, without ever hitting a remote server.

Use a deep neural network to borrow the skills of real artists and turn your two-bit doodles into masterpieces! This project is an implementation of a style transfer algorithm, based on the algorithm (Li, 2016). The script generates a new image by using one, two, three, or four images as inputs depending on what you're trying to do: the original style and its annotation, and a target content image (optional) with its annotation (a.k.a. your doodle). The algorithm extracts annotated patches from the style image and incrementally transfers them over to the target image based on how closely they match.

Extracted text: ## AirSim announcement: This repository will be archived in the coming year 

In 2017 Microsoft Research created AirSim as a simulation platform for AI research and experimentation. Over the span of five years, this research project has served its purpose—and gained a lot of ground—as a common way to share research code and test new ideas around aerial AI development and simulation. Additionally, time has yielded advancements in the way we apply technology to the real world, particularly through aerial mobility and autonomous systems. For example, drone delivery is no longer a sci-fi storyline—it’s a business reality, which means there are new needs to be met. We’ve learned a lot in the process, and we want to thank this community for your engagement along the way.

In the spirit of forward momentum, we will be releasing a new simulation platform in the coming year and subsequently archiving the original 2017 AirSim. Users will still have access to the original AirSim code beyond that point, but no further updates will be made, effective immediately. Instead, we will focus our efforts on a new product, Microsoft Project AirSim, to meet the growing needs of the aerospace industry. Project AirSim will provide an end-to-end platform for safely developing and testing aerial autonomy through simulation. Users will benefit from the safety, code review, testing, advanced simulation, and AI capabilities that are uniquely available in a commercial product. 

# Welcome to AirSim

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine (we now also have an experimental Unity release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. Similarly, we have an experimental release for a Unity plugin.

Our goal is to develop AirSim as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, AirSim also exposes APIs to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way.

Extracted text: # Chewy

Chewy is an ODM (Object Document Mapper), built on top of Elasticsearch. 

## Why Chewy?

In this section, we'll cover why you might want to use Chewy instead of the official client gem.

* Every index is observable by all the related models. Most of the indexed models are related to others, and sometimes it is necessary to denormalize this related data and put it in the same object. For example, you need to index an array of tags together with an article. Chewy allows you to specify an updateable index for every model separately - so corresponding articles will be reindexed on any tag update.

* Bulk import everywhere. Chewy utilizes the bulk ES API for full reindexing or index updates. It also uses atomic updates. All the changed objects are collected inside the atomic block, and the index is updated once at the end with all the collected objects.

* Powerful querying DSL. Chewy has an ActiveRecord-style query DSL. It is chainable, mergeable, and lazy, so you can produce queries in the most efficient way. It also has object-oriented query and filter builders.

* Support for ActiveRecord.

In the last few years, we've seen more of the application moved to the client-side, with JavaScript representations of views, templates, and models. This can result in interactive, native-style apps, but it also poses challenges. SEO, performance, and maintainability become issues with splitting up your app into two distinct codebases, often in different languages. 

Rendr is intended to be a building block along the way to this envisioned future of web apps that can be run on either side of the wire according to the needs of your application.

Extracted text: ## GASContent
Repo to gather all GAS content for UE4. Note: I accept PRs for this repo, but I no longer actively seek out new content for it.

## Gameplay Ability System

### GAS Intro
(Taken from "Gameplay Abilities and You")

#### So, what's a GameplayAbility?
Basically, they're like the abilities you have in Dota or equivalent games. You can cast a fireball, and this fireball hits a player, explodes (doing a set amount of damage), and sets everyone in the radius of the explosion on fire (doing damage over time). Meanwhile, the player who cast the fireball loses some mana and is put on cooldown.

You could use Epic's GameplayAbility plugin to do all of those things. The module is hard to wrap your head around, but once you learn how powerful they can be and how to properly make use of them, they can make your life much, much easier.

#### But why use this over rolling your own system?
GameplayAbilities can come in handy if your game is in need of a powerful skill, buff, and attribute system that is both easy to extend and crazy-efficient to replicate. This can do wonders for people working on a multiplayer RPG with a lot of skills/classes or perhaps even a MOBA, but you can use this system for pretty much any game you want. The main problem is that it isn't the easiest to comprehend, quite big, and may get a little in your way the further you stray too far away from this multiplayer RPG ideal, so not every game will get the same mileage out of it.

#### Well, that sounds like a dream, but where do I get it?
GameplayAbilities is a code module that used to be integrated into UE4's source, but since version 4.15, it has been moved into a separate plugin that is delivered alongside the Unreal Engine. This system does not actually originate as a built-in engine feature but has been kindly left in there from the developers of Paragon and Fortnite for third parties to enjoy. Unfortunately, due to these unique circumstances, the module as a whole is quite messy, poorly documented, and rarely updated and cleaned up.

It is also not 100% exposed to blueprints, partially due to a lot of the system abusing a lot of engine trickery and magic to work as well as they do. If you never worked with C++ in the context of UE4, you may want to turn back and maybe do a little tutorial on that now, because this tutorial will make for a poor first learning experience.

In other words, it is a total pain to wrap your head around, but that's where this guide comes in to help you.

- Description: Content-Addressable Data Synchronization Tool

Extracted text: # casync — Content Addressable Data Synchronizer

What is this?

1. A combination of the rsync algorithm and content-addressable storage
2. An efficient way to store and retrieve multiple related versions of large file systems or directory trees
3. An efficient way to deliver and update OS, VM, IoT and container images over the Internet in an HTTP and CDN friendly way
4. An efficient backup system

Encoding: Lets take a large linear data stream, split it into variable-sized chunks (the size of each being a function of the chunks contents), and store these chunks in individual, compressed files in some directory, each file named after a strong hash value of its contents, so that the hash value may be used to as key for retrieving the full chunk data. Lets call this directory a "chunk store". At the same time, generate a "chunk index" file that lists these chunk hash values plus their respective chunk sizes in a simple linear array. The chunking algorithm is supposed to create variable, but similarly sized chunks from the data stream, and do so in a way that the same data results in the same chunks even if placed at varying offsets.

Decoding: Lets take the chunk index file, and reassemble the large linear data stream by concatenating the uncompressed chunks retrieved from the chunk store, keyed by the listed chunk hash values.

As an extra twist, we introduce a well-defined, reproducible, random-access serialization format for directory trees to permit efficient, stable storage of complete directory trees in the system, simply by serializing them and then passing them into the encoding step explained above.

Finally, lets put all this on the network: for each image you want to deliver, generate a chunk index file and place it on an HTTP server. Do the same with the chunk store, and share it between the various index files you intend to deliver.

Why bother with all of this? Streams with similar contents will result in mostly the same chunk files in the chunk store. This means it is very efficient to store many related versions of a data stream in the same chunk store, thus minimizing disk usage. Moreover, when transferring linear data streams chunks already known on the receiving side can be made use of, thus minimizing network traffic.

Why is this different from other tools? One major difference is that we remove file boundaries before chunking things up. This means that small files are lumped together with their siblings and large files are chopped into pieces, which permits us to recognize similarities in files and directories beyond file boundaries, and makes sure our chunk sizes are pretty evenly distributed, without the file boundaries affecting them.

The "chunking" algorithm is based on the buzhash rolling hash function. SHA512/256 is used as a strong hash function to generate digests of the chunks (alternatively: SHA256). zstd is used to compress the individual chunks (alternatively xz or gzip).

Is this new? Conceptually, not too much. This uses well-known concepts, implemented in a variety of other projects, and puts them together in a moderately new, nice way. The primary influences are rsync and git, but there are other systems that use similar algorithms.

Extracted text: # ImplicitCAD: Math Inspired CAD

## Introduction

ImplicitCAD is a programmatic CAD program, implemented in Haskell. Unlike traditional CAD programs, programmatic CAD programs use text descriptions of objects, as in programming. Concepts like variables, control structures and abstraction are used, just as in programming. This provides a number of advantages:

- Objects can be abstracted and reused
- Repetitive tasks can be automated
- Objects can be designed parametrically
- The usual tools for software development (like version control) can be used

The traditional example of programmatic CAD is OpenSCAD.

Generally, objects in programmatic CAD are built with Constructive Solid Geometry or CSG. Unions, intersections and differences of simpler shapes slowly build the object. ImplicitCAD supports all this and much more! For example, it provides rounded unions so that one can have smooth interfaces between objects.

It also directly provides some GCode generation, and has a parser for OpenSCAD to make it easier for people to transition/use.

ImplicitCAD is very much a work in progress. The author considers it ready for beta testers and greatly appreciates bug reports.

A (or golang for search engine friendliness) implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

In short, it's a signed JSON object that does something useful (for example, authentication). It's commonly used for tokens in OAuth 2. A token is made of three parts, separated by dots. The first two parts are JSON objects that have been encoded. The last part is the signature, encoded the same way.

The first part is called the header. It contains the necessary information for verifying the last part, the signature. For example, which encryption method was used for signing and what key was used.

The part in the middle is the interesting bit. It's called the Claims and contains the actual stuff you care about. 

This library supports the parsing and verification as well as the generation and signing of JWTs. Current supported signing algorithms are HMAC SHA, RSA, RSA-PSS, and ECDSA, though hooks are present for adding your own.

Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air.

When the plugin is correctly loaded, there will be a nice statusline at the bottom of each vim window. That line consists of several sections, each one displaying some piece of information. By default (without configuration) this line will look like this:

The statusline is the colored line at the bottom, which contains the sections (possibly in different colors):

section|meaning (example)
-------|------------------
  A    | displays the mode + additional flags like crypt/spell/paste (INSERT)
  B    | Environment status (VCS information - branch, hunk summary (master), [battery] level)
  C    | filename + read-only flag (~/.vim/vimrc RO)
  X    | filetype  (vim)
  Y    | file encoding[fileformat] (utf-8[unix])
  Z    | current position in the file
 [...] | additional sections (warning/errors/statistics) from external plugins (e.g. YCM, syntastic, ...)

For a better look, those sections can be colored differently, depending on various conditions (e.g. the mode or whether the current file is modified).

Schema is the foundation of your application. It should be something you can read, write, and understand. Forget foreign keys; tabular data modeling is a relic of an older age. Instead, EdgeDB thinks about schema the same way you do: as object types containing properties connected by links.

EdgeDB's super-powered query language EdgeQL is designed as a ground-up redesign of SQL. EdgeQL queries produce rich, structured objects, not flat lists of rows. Deeply fetching related objects is painless, and EdgeQL queries are composable, making subqueries and nested mutations easy.

While EdgeDB solves the same problems as ORM libraries, it's so much more. It's a full-fledged database with a CLI, a client library in different languages, and a cloud hosting platform coming soon. The goal is to rethink every aspect of how developers model, migrate, manage, and query their database.

Extracted text: # Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression

This repository contains the implementation code for the paper: __Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression__, presented at the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2021).

Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) aims to learn from imbalanced data with continuous targets, tackle potential missing data for certain regions, and generalize to the entire target range.

Existing techniques for learning from imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., the targets are different classes. However, many real-world tasks involve continuous and even infinite target values. We systematically investigate Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR), which aims to learn continuous targets from natural imbalanced data, deal with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalize to the entire target range.

We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets for common real-world tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains, ranging from single-value prediction such as age, text similarity score, health condition score, to dense-value prediction such as depth.

A fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners (and ovals or circles) based on the original. It supports many additional features including ovals, rounded rectangles, ScaleTypes, and TileModes.

There are many ways to create rounded corners in Android, but this is the fastest and best one that I know of because it:
* does not create a copy of the original bitmap
* does not use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased
* does not use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas

Also has proper support for:
* Borders (with Colors and ColorStateLists)
* Ovals and Circles
* All s
  * Borders are drawn at view edge, not bitmap edge
  * Except on edges where the bitmap is smaller than the view
  * Borders are not scaled up/down with the image (correct width and radius are maintained)
* Anti-aliasing
* Transparent backgrounds
* Hardware acceleration
* Support for LayerDrawables (including TransitionDrawables)

## About

This is a starter boilerplate app I've put together using the following technologies:

* Isomorphic rendering
* Both client and server make calls to load data from a separate API server
* ES6 and ES7 magic
* Webpack for bundling
* Redux/React Router bindings
* Redux Form to manage form state in Redux
* Redux Thunk to speed up form validation
* Combine reducers into one key-based reducer
* CSS Modules to allow import of stylesheets in plain CSS, Sass, and Less
* React Helmet to manage title and meta tag information on both server and client
* Allow require() to work for statics both on client and server
* Unit testing for the project

I cobbled this together from a wide variety of similar "starter" repositories. As I post this in June 2015, all of these libraries are right at the bleeding edge of web development. They may fall out of fashion as quickly as they have come into it, but I personally believe that this stack is the future of web development and will survive for several years. I'm building my new projects like this, and I recommend that you do, too.

browserify is a tool for compiling commonjs modules for the browser.

You can use browserify to organize your code and use third-party libraries even if you don't use it in any other capacity except for bundling and installing packages with npm.

The module system that browserify uses is the same as node, so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too.

Increasingly, people are publishing modules to npm which are intentionally designed to work in both node and in the browser using browserify, and many packages on npm are intended for use in just the browser, front or backend alike.

### What is GitOps?

GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery, it works by using Git as a source of truth for declarative infrastructure and workloads. For Kubernetes, this means using Git as the source of truth.

### What is Progressive Delivery?

Progressive delivery is an umbrella term for advanced deployment patterns like canaries, feature flags, and A/B testing. Progressive delivery techniques are used to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by giving app developers and SRE teams fine-grained control over the blast radius. In this workshop, you'll be using Istio and Prometheus to automate Canary Releases and A/B Testing for your applications.

- Description: a javascript static security analysis tool

Extracted text: Introduction
===============  
Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple: JavaScript has now been accepted as the mainstream programming language for applications, whether on the web or mobile, client-side or server-side. JavaScript's flexibility and loose typing are friendly to developers, allowing them to create rich applications at an unbelievable speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters have almost eliminated scalability and throughput concerns for many organizations. JavaScript is now a powerful language with growing usage every day, expanding from client-side code in web applications to server-side through Node.JS and being supported as a proper language for major mobile operating system platforms.

However, many developers practice insecure coding, leading to client-side attacks, with DOM XSS being the most infamous. We identified that the root cause of this problem is the lack of practically usable tools to address real-world issues. As our first attempt to solve this problem, we present JSPrime: A JavaScript static analysis tool for the rest of us. It is a lightweight and easy-to-use point-and-click tool based on the popular Esprima ECMAScript parser by Aria Hidayat.

Description
===============  
JSPrime offers several interesting features, including:
- JS Library Aware Source & Sinks
- Variable & Function Tracing
- Variable & Function Scope Aware analysis
- Known filter function aware
- OOP & Prototype Compliant
- Minimum False Positive alerts
- Supports minified JavaScript
- Blazing fast performance
- Point and Click interface

Upcoming features include automatic code de-obfuscation & decompression through Hybrid Analysis and support for the ECMAScript family (ActionScript 3, Node.JS, WinJS).

It uses UIKit Dynamics for all animation—there's not a single call to UIKit in the project.

It integrates with Apple's UIKit Dynamics APIs (new in iOS7) to provide a realistic new feel to the classic drawer navigation paradigm. While the documentation can do it some justice, it's best to just clone, build, and run the example project on a device to get a feel for how it performs.

> A curated list of awesome projects related to eBPF.

BPF, as in Berkeley Packet Filter, is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space. Initially implemented on BSD, then Linux, the (now legacy) "classic BPF" or cBPF machine would be used with tools like tcpdump for filtering packets in the kernel to avoid useless copies to user space. More recently, the BPF infrastructure in Linux has been completely reworked and gave life to the "extended BPF", or eBPF, which gained new features (safety and termination checks, JIT-compiling for programs, persistent maps, a standard library, hardware offload support, etc.) and is now used for many tasks. Processing packets at a very low level (XDP), tracing and monitoring events on the system, or enforcing access control over cgroups are but a few examples to which eBPF brings performance, programmability and flexibility.

Extracted text: # Seata: Simple Extensible Autonomous Transaction Architecture

## What is Seata?

A distributed transaction solution with high performance and ease of use for microservices architecture.

### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices

In a traditional monolithic application, data consistency is guaranteed by local transactions. However, in a microservices architecture, where services operate on different data sources, maintaining data consistency across the entire business logic becomes challenging.

### How Seata Works

Seata addresses this problem by defining a Distributed Transaction as a Global Transaction composed of multiple Branch Transactions, which are typically Local Transactions. The Seata Framework includes three roles:

- **Transaction Coordinator (TC)**: Maintains the status of global and branch transactions, driving the global commit or rollback.
- **Transaction Manager (TM)**: Defines the scope of the global transaction, including beginning, committing, or rolling back the transaction.
- **Resource Manager (RM)**: Manages resources for branch transactions, registers branch transactions with TC, and reports their status.

A typical lifecycle of a Seata-managed distributed transaction involves the TM initiating a global transaction, propagating an XID through the microservices, and the TC coordinating the commit or rollback of all branch transactions associated with that global transaction.

Extracted text: Fixed Data Tables for React
====================================

FixedDataTable is a React component for building and presenting data in a flexible, powerful way. It supports standard table features, like headers, columns, rows, header groupings, and both fixed-position and scrolling columns.

The table was designed to handle thousands of rows of data without sacrificing performance. Scrolling smoothly is a first-class goal of FixedDataTable and it includes features such as fixed headers and footer, both fixed and scrollable columns, handling huge amounts of data, variable row heights (with adaptive scroll positions), column resizing, performant scrolling, customizable styling, jumping to a row or column, and a controlled scroll API that allows touch support. 

However, FixedDataTable does not provide a layout reflow mechanism or calculate content layout information such as width and height of the cell contents. The developer has to provide the layout information to the table instead. It also does not handle sorting of data, allowing the developer to supply data getters that can be sort-, filter-, or tail-loading-aware, and it does not fetch the data.

Extracted text: # jQuery UI Bootstrap (v 1.0 Alpha)

This project was started to bring the beauty and ease-of-use of Bootstrap to jQuery UI widgets. 

Bootstrap is one of our favorite projects, but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things:

* The ability to work side-by-side with jQuery UI (something which caused a number of widgets to break visually)
* The ability to theme jQuery UI widgets using Bootstrap styles. Whilst we love jQuery UI, we find some of the current themes to look a little dated. Our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same.

To clarify, this project doesn't aim or intend to replace Bootstrap. It merely provides a jQuery UI-compatible theme inspired by Bootstrap's design. It also provides a version of Bootstrap CSS with a few (minor) sections commented out which enable the theme to work alongside it. 

We welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible.

WebExt Redux allows you to build your Web Extension like a Redux-powered web app. The background page holds the Redux store, while Popovers and Content-Scripts act as UI Components, passing actions and state updates between themselves and the background store. At the end of the day, you have a single source of truth (your Redux store) that describes the entire state of your extension. 

All UI Components follow the same basic flow:

1. UI Component dispatches action to a Proxy Store.
2. Proxy Store passes action to background script.
3. Redux Store on the background script updates its state and sends it back to UI Component.
4. UI Component is updated with updated state.

A cloud-native database developed by Alibaba Cloud

## Overview

PolarDB for PostgreSQL (hereafter simplified as PolarDB) is a cloud native database service independently developed by Alibaba Cloud. This service is 100% compatible with PostgreSQL and uses a shared-storage-based architecture in which computing is decoupled from storage. This service features flexible scalability, millisecond-level latency and hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) capabilities.

1. Flexible scalability: You can use the service to scale out a compute cluster or a storage cluster based on your business requirements.
   - If the computing power is insufficient, you can scale out only the compute cluster.
   - If the storage capacity or the storage I/O is insufficient, you can scale out a storage cluster without interrupting your service.
2. Millisecond-level latency:
   - Write-ahead logging (WAL) logs are stored in the shared storage. Only the metadata of WAL records is replicated from the read-write node to read-only nodes.
   - The LogIndex technology provided by PolarDB features two record replay modes: lazy replay and parallel replay. The technology can be used to minimize the record replication latency from the read-write node to read-only nodes.
3. HTAP: HTAP is implemented by using a shared-storage-based massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. The architecture is used to accelerate online analytical processing (OLAP) queries in online transaction processing (OLTP) scenarios. PolarDB supports a complete suite of data types that are used in OLTP scenarios. PolarDB supports two computing engines that can process these types of data:
   - Standalone execution: processes OLTP queries that feature high concurrency.
   - Distributed execution: processes large OLAP queries.

PolarDB provides a wide range of innovative multi-model database capabilities to help you process, analyze, and search for different types of data, such as spatio-temporal, geographic information system (GIS), image, vector, and graph data.

These components plug into each other and build on top of the high-performance, low-latency AudioUnits API, providing an easy-to-use API written in Objective-C instead of pure C. 

The framework is designed to work transparently across all iOS and OSX devices, offering a universal API whether you're building for Mac or iOS.

Generated About: A simple, intuitive audio framework for iOS and OSX.

- Description: Modularized Implementation of Deep RL Algorithms in PyTorch

Extracted text: # DeepRL

Modularized implementation of popular deep RL algorithms in PyTorch. Easy switch between toy tasks and challenging games.

Implemented algorithms:
* (Double/Dueling/Prioritized) Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
* Categorical DQN (C51)
* Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN)
* (Continuous/Discrete) Synchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
* Synchronous N-Step Q-Learning (N-Step DQN)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* The Option-Critic Architecture (OC)
* Twined Delayed DDPG (TD3)

The DQN agent, as well as C51 and QR-DQN, has an asynchronous actor for data generation and an asynchronous replay buffer for transferring data to GPU. Using 1 RTX 2080 Ti and 3 threads, the DQN agent runs for 10M steps (40M frames, 2.5M gradient updates) for Breakout within 6 hours.

- Description: A platform to create documentation/wiki content built with PHP & Laravel

Extracted text: # BookStack

A platform for storing and organising information and documentation. 

BookStack is an opinionated wiki system that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.

BookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above.

In regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. At the end of the day this is free software developed and maintained by people donating their own free time.

- Description: Efficiently computes derivatives of numpy code.

Extracted text: # Autograd

Autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion, and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd is gradient-based optimization.
