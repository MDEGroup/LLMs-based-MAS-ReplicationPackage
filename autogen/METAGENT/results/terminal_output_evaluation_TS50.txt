- Description: A GitOps recipe for Progressive Delivery with Flux v2, Flagger and Istio

[Extractor sent]: # gitops-istio

This is a guide where you will get hands-on experience with GitOps and Progressive Delivery using Kubernetes and Istio.

## Introduction

### What is GitOps?

GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery, it works by using Git as a source of truth for declarative infrastructure and workloads. For Kubernetes, this means using Git as the source of truth.

### What is Progressive Delivery?

Progressive delivery is an umbrella term for advanced deployment patterns like canaries, feature flags, and A/B testing. Progressive delivery techniques are used to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by giving app developers and SRE teams fine-grained control over the blast radius. In this workshop, you'll be using Istio and Prometheus to automate Canary Releases and A/B Testing for your applications.

- Description: a javascript static security analysis tool

[Extractor sent]: Introduction
===============  
Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple: JavaScript has now been accepted as the mainstream programming language for applications, whether on the web or mobile, client-side or server-side. JavaScript's flexibility and loose typing allow developers to create rich applications at an incredible speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters have almost eliminated concerns about scalability and throughput for many organizations. JavaScript is now a powerful language with growing usage, evolving from client-side code in web applications to server-side through Node.JS, and is supported as a proper language for major mobile operating systems.

However, many developers practice insecure coding, leading to client-side attacks, with DOM XSS being the most infamous. We identified that the root cause of this problem is the lack of practically usable tools to address real-world issues. As our first attempt to solve this problem, we present JSPrime: A JavaScript static analysis tool that is lightweight and easy to use. The tool is based on the popular Esprima ECMAScript parser.

Description
===============  
JSPrime offers several interesting features, including:
- JS Library Aware Source & Sinks
- Variable & Function Tracing
- Variable & Function Scope Aware analysis
- Known filter function awareness
- OOP & Prototype Compliance
- Minimum False Positive alerts
- Support for minified JavaScript
- Blazing fast performance
- Point and Click interface

Upcoming features include automatic code de-obfuscation and ECMAScript family support.

MSDynamicsDrawerViewController is a container view controller that manages the presentation of a single "pane" view controller overlaid over one or two "drawer" view controllers. The drawer view controllers are hidden by default but can be exposed by a user-initiated swipe in the direction that the drawer view controller is hidden in. It uses UIKit Dynamics for all animation.

A curated list of awesome projects related to eBPF.

BPF, as in Berkeley Packet Filter, is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space. Initially implemented on BSD, then Linux, the (now legacy) "classic BPF" or cBPF machine would be used with tools like tcpdump for filtering packets in the kernel to avoid useless copies to user space. More recently, the BPF infrastructure in Linux has been completely reworked and gave life to the "extended BPF", or eBPF, which gained new features (safety and termination checks, JIT-compiling for programs, persistent maps, a standard library, hardware offload support, etc.) and is now used for many tasks. Processing packets at a very low level (XDP), tracing and monitoring events on the system, or enforcing access control over cgroups are but a few examples to which eBPF brings performance, programmability and flexibility.

## What is Seata?

A distributed transaction solution with high performance and ease of use for microservices architecture.

### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices

In a microservices architecture, data consistency is guaranteed by local transactions within each service, but challenges arise when ensuring consistency across multiple services.

### How Seata do?

Seata addresses the distributed transaction problem by defining a Global Transaction made up of Branch Transactions, which are typically Local Transactions. It involves three roles: Transaction Coordinator (TC), Transaction Manager (TM), and Resource Manager (RM), each responsible for different aspects of transaction management. 

A typical lifecycle of a Seata-managed distributed transaction includes initiating a global transaction, propagating transaction identifiers, registering local transactions, and committing or rolling back transactions as needed.

[Extractor sent]: #jQuery UI Bootstrap (v 1.0 Alpha)

This project was started to bring the beauty and ease-of-use of Bootstrap to jQuery UI widgets. 

Bootstrap is one of our favorite projects, but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things:

* The ability to work side-by-side with jQuery UI (something which caused a number of widgets to break visually)
* The ability to theme jQuery UI widgets using Bootstrap styles. Whilst we love jQuery UI, we find some of the current themes to look a little dated. Our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same.

To clarify, this project doesn't aim or intend to replace Bootstrap. It merely provides a jQuery UI-compatible theme inspired by Bootstrap's design. It also provides a version of Bootstrap CSS with a few (minor) sections commented out which enable the theme to work alongside it. 

We welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible.

[Extractor sent]: # PolarDB for PostgreSQL

A cloud-native database developed by Alibaba Cloud

## Overview

PolarDB for PostgreSQL (hereafter simplified as PolarDB) is a cloud native database service independently developed by Alibaba Cloud. This service is 100% compatible with PostgreSQL and uses a shared-storage-based architecture in which computing is decoupled from storage. This service features flexible scalability, millisecond-level latency and hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) capabilities.

1. Flexible scalability: You can use the service to scale out a compute cluster or a storage cluster based on your business requirements.
   - If the computing power is insufficient, you can scale out only the compute cluster.
   - If the storage capacity or the storage I/O is insufficient, you can scale out a storage cluster without interrupting your service.
2. Millisecond-level latency:
   - Write-ahead logging (WAL) logs are stored in the shared storage. Only the metadata of WAL records is replicated from the read-write node to read-only nodes.
   - The LogIndex technology provided by PolarDB features two record replay modes: lazy replay and parallel replay. The technology can be used to minimize the record replication latency from the read-write node to read-only nodes.
3. HTAP: HTAP is implemented by using a shared-storage-based massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. The architecture is used to accelerate online analytical processing (OLAP) queries in online transaction processing (OLTP) scenarios. PolarDB supports a complete suite of data types that are used in OLTP scenarios. PolarDB supports two computing engines that can process these types of data:
   - Standalone execution: processes OLTP queries that feature high concurrency.
   - Distributed execution: processes large OLAP queries.

PolarDB provides a wide range of innovative multi-model database capabilities to help you process, analyze, and search for different types of data, such as spatio-temporal, geographic information system (GIS), image, vector, and graph data.

[Extractor sent]: # The Solidity Contract-Oriented Programming Language

Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. 

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow anyone to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

Folding Tab Bar and Tab Bar Controller

## Introduction

#### YALFoldingTabBarController
is a subclass of with custom animating.

#### YALFoldingTabBar
YALFoldingTabBar is a subclass of a standard UIView. We wanted to make this component expand and contract in response to a user tapping. When the component is closed you can only see a central button (‚Äú+‚Äù). When tapping on it, our custom Tab Bar expands letting other tabBarItems appear, so that the user can switch the controllers.

Each separate tabBarItem can have two additional buttons on the left and right. These buttons can be used to let a user interact with a selected screen on the YALFoldingTabBarController without even having to leave it.

#### YALTabBarItem
is a model to configure your tab bar items with images.

New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.

BookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above. In regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. At the end of the day this is free software developed and maintained by people donating their own free time.

[Extractor sent]: # Autograd

Autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion, and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd is gradient-based optimization.
